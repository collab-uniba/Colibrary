	<review>This book is helpful for those struggling with pornography and lust. Every pastor should read this book and consider it for use in pornography-recovery groups; I intend to use it so. </review>

	<review>I think there is a detency in Christianity to only talk about the sins that affect other people and not "us."  Abortion, homosexuality, and the like get sermon after sermon.  We even get lectures on smoking, which the Bible does not speak about at all.  Meanwhile, other struggles are kept in the dark out of embarrassment.  Lust and pornography run rampant in the Church, and whenever someone talks about them, they are hushed down.This book takes on the subject head on and without apology.  It's about time!  The authors give a very clear and good explanation of what the problem is, and some ideas to deal with it.This book is a must read for anyone who struggled with sexual temptation (as in, all the men and half of the women). </review>
