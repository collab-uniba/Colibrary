	<review>At first I enjoyed the unconventional presentation and the style of the narrative, as the character of Christopher was revealed, along with the plot, but about three quarters of the way through it began to be a chore to read it rather than a pleasure. However, I felt I learned quite a lot about Asperger's Syndrome, although I have since seen a fair amount of criticism from people claiming to have Asperger's who say it's not a good representation. That said, I still think it's worth reading. </review>

	<review>I've been itching to read this book                       for months. But when I finally received                       it for my birthday and read it, I was                       disappointed. An autistic narrator                        did not seem to always make an engaging                       narrator. In addition, the adult topics                       the childlike narrator was confronting                       were jarring to the innocent tone of the                       book. In some ways, my reaction to this                       book is similar to my feelings about                       most graphic novels; the adult situations                       and conflicts feel inappropriate in what                       should be a protected environment. </review>

	<review>I really enjoyed this novel and felt for the parents in the story. Raising children is challenging, let alone raising a child with a disability. Very enlightening on the subject of autism. I learned a lot and the story made me sad, but I really liked it. </review>

	<review>***Update***After reading Look Me in the Eye, I am willing to believe that Christopher's thinking is pretty close to the mark. Robison didn't write exactly like Haddon, but there were enough similarities to make it plausible.***End Update***My biggest question is whether Haddon nailed the perspective. I like the story and I think it’s well written, but does someone with Asperger’s, or some other form of high-functioning autism, really think, act, and feel the way Christopher does? I looked into it, using Asperger’s as my diagnosis, and determined that Christopher could well be a mathematical savant. It’s definitely in the realm of possibility. His little quirks such as hating specific colors and needing a set schedule also make perfect sense. So, Haddon’s got the technical bit down.I just don’t know if someone with Asperger’s would narrate like Christopher. It seems like a abnormal psychology textbook’s entry explaining “this is how someone with Asperger’s thinks.” It may very well be accurate, it just feels off. Christopher uses a lot of “this made me scared”-type descriptions. So, I don’t know. I’m reading Look Me in the Eye for more perspective.That said, the book is great. </review>

	<review>Although I understand that the book was supposed to have been written by the autistic student, the writing was nerve wracking. The stream of consciousness of the student especially in math was definitely indicative of an autistic although mathematically adept student. The story did nothing for me. I wonder how it received any high reviews?? ICK!!</review>

	<review>The story this book tells is of itself quite unremarkable. At its heart is a family breakup and the impact on those affected. What is intriguing, illuminating and utterly engaging is the way in which the story is told through the eyes of its main character Christopher Boone. Christopher is fifteen and suffers from Asperger's, a form of autism. The book tells the story of its writing as a school project through his eyes, experiences and way of seeing the world. Christopher has a photographic memory, he has a brilliant understanding of science and mathematics, but can't understand human beings. His mind is utterly logical and whilst it can manipulate numbers with astonishing ease is powerless to understand a raised eyebrow or fathom the meaning of `raining cats and dogs' other than literally. We are drawn into Christopher's world, we see things as he sees them and in doing so we come to understand a little of Asperger's and Autism, but beyond that we begin to glimpse how easily we assume that our way of seeing the world, is the way of seeing the world. A wonderfully insightful book for anyone who wishes to understand autism and more generally become more aware and understanding of other people's perspectives. </review>

	<review>Told through the eyes of an autistic boy named Christopher, "The Curious Incident..." feels different than other fiction because of the fresh perspective. The events are mundane, but the narrator's interactions with others make for laugh-out-loud situations.Christopher can often be maddening, and you empathize for the frustration in those around him. He is totally devoid of emotion or imagination. He's coldly logical and methodical, and has a tendency to sit for hours thinking through math problems. And he's focused like a laser-beam, to the point of being obsessive. He remembers anything. So, Christopher is basically a robot.None of the characters are flat. His sweet father... with a violent-side. His loving mother, with her lack of morals and inability to deal with conflict.The portrayal is blunt and doesn't pull punches. This book could have easily had a preachy theme about "autistics are great people once you get to know them..." but luckily it never devolves into that - Christopher's behavior is shown in all it's unpleasant glory. I liked it and would definitely recommend it. </review>

	<review>A quick read from the point of view of an autistic boy. I enjoyed the book from the very beginning. I was surprised though how fast the murder mystery was solved. The events that took place after that weakened the book. I stopped caring about what was going to happen to Christopher. Luckily the ending was satisfying enough to make the book a worth while read. </review>

	<review>I do my best not to be an armchair psychiatrist because invariably such endeavors show my utter ignorance in the realm of psychiatry and the workings of the human brain, but I wonder what my extreme love of the spare style used to write this book says about me. The trope of the book is that Christopher Boone, a 15-year-old autistic savant, discovered a neighbor’s dead dog, stabbed to death with a pitchfork, and decided to write a book about his attempts to solve the dog’s murder. As he writes his book, Christopher uncovers a shocking family secret and is forced to crawl outside the extreme limits his autism place upon him. Of course, I won’t spoil the ending but the plot, while at times a little obvious, is overshadowed by the experience of spending time in Christopher’s head, a time that is nerve-wracking, saddening, frustrating and amazing.

	<review>When he discovers his neighbor's dead dog, autistic teenager Christopher John Francis Boone decides to solve the murder. He likes to read mystery novels and decides to write his own book as he investigates the death. The adults in his life discourage him from looking into the dog's death, especially his father, but Christopher has made up his mind and forges ahead. What Christopher doesn't realize is that there are more mysteries in his life than just a murdered dog and he begins to uncover truths that would be hard for anyone, autistic or not, to take. These truths will lead Christopher on one of the most frightening journeys in his young life. "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time" is a brilliantly written, at times heart-breaking novel. Written in the first person, author Mark Haddon does an excellent job of getting into Christopher's mind, to the point where it seems as if Christopher is a real person. The footnotes that pop up throughout the book also make it seem as if a real person is telling a real story. There are many excellent moments in the novel that show how an autistic person thinks, starting with the fact that each chapter begins with a prime number and including Christopher's need to tell the time, down to the last second, that something happened, and his belief that the color of cars that he sees can make it a good day or a bad day. The book has several humorous moments, but never at Christopher's expense. While the plot may seem simple, it uncovers many layers of Christopher's life. Although the book is written from Christopher's limited point of view, Haddon is a gifted writer and we still learn much about the people in his life, especially his parents, long before Christopher himself does and in fact, readers learn more than Christopher ever can. "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time" was so good that I hated to see it end. Well done. </review>

	<review>Overall I enjoyed the book. I was very captivated by the boys thinking and process for daily activities that would not seem very difficult or intense. Everything he did was an adventure and sometimes made me nervous. His character was sometimes a ticking time bomb. He never touched things that were yellow and he never liked to be touched by people. Reading this story gave me a better understanding about autistic children. i think this is a great book for everyone to read, especially teachers.  </review>

	<review>"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time" was funny, and informative, but also sad. This book is a murder mystery. The main character Chris is trying to solve the mystery of how his neighbor's dog, Wellington, died. Chris is autistic and since the book is written from his point of view, the reader can see what life is like from an autistic person's point of view. Chris is very good at math, especially prime numbers. When he is angry he adds up all the prime numbers he knows to calm himself down. He has very specific likes and dislikes about colors: "4 red cars in a row made it a good day, and 3 red cars in row made it a quite good day, and 5 red cars in row made it a super good day, and 4 yellow cars in a row made it a black day, which is a day when I don't speak to anyone and sit on my own reading books and don't eat my lunch and take no risks." During his investigation, Chris makes many troubling discoveries about his own life and about his parents. This story is really many stories in one. I think this is very clever and I liked that alot. I think the only thing that was a little disappointing was that the mystery was solved too early in the book, but other than that it was a great book.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries, puzzels, or math. I would also recommend this to people who are interested in learning more about autism. "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time" is 226 pages long, which includes diagrams, drawings, and even a math problem at the end of the book! </review>

	<review>This was sad. And I don't like sad books so I only gave it a 3. I did, however like how the main character was autistic. You know how when you read about someone with the flu and you think you have the flu, or you hear something about breast cancer and you automatically wonder if you have breast cancer? While I was reading this book I kept wondering "Am I kind of autistic? Are my kids autistic?" So that was interesting. Also there was a lot of swearing in this book. Which I found unnecessary and it adversely affected my enjoyment of this book. </review>

	<review>This book is truly a work of art. Narrated by an autistic teenager, this book gives insight of the autistic mind that is unmatched. The one thing that was kind of annoying was the repetetiveness. I understand that autistic people do think a certain way, but the point that they think randomly and differently was bit hackneyed. Overall, however, this book is a must read for anybody who knows or is related to an autistic person.</review>

	<review>The Curious Incident of the dog in the night-time is all about a boy with autism and the way he looks at the world.  This book was extremely intresting as it offered a vivid picture of how autistic kids view the world so logically and how socially inept they are.  For example, I often found myself amazed at how easily the main character, Chris, was able to do complex math problems that I didn't have a clue as to how to even begin.  At the same time, I almost laughed at how shy and awkward he was, fearing for his life everytime he saw a stranger and refusing to say anything more than absolutely neccesary.  The problem is, most people only see the social side of those with autism, obviously leading them to believe that there is no hope for this person and that they are no more worthy of being called a person then thier own pet.  However, by getting this rare glipse into how an autistic kid's mind really works and the complex logic they're able to do, many people would gain a lot of respect for them as people, and begin to care about them more.  It is because this point was made so obvious in the book that it is truly a great book about human feeling and really taught me alot about autism.</review>

	<review>I thought this book was absolutely fantastic. It is true that I really only read it for a school summer reading assignment for my Psychology class, but just after starting it immediately became one of my favorite books. I am a bit of a math fanatic. I just find it interesting and enjoyable. I actually had quite a lot of fun reading through some of the specific math problems the Haddon puts in the book. That could be the reason behind my great interest in this piece. Another aspect that definitely drew me to it was the authors main goal: the portrayal of a life in the eyes of a teenage math wizard with autism. This idea is just so interesting. It reminded me profoundly of Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, but the idea of a teenager in this situation clearly made this book more relatable. Now, the whole storyline of this book is very bizarre (just read the title...), but the underlying statements about real life hardships and problems make it extremely entertaining at, at times, even moving. I typically don't get too ridiculously drawn in by books, but this one was a clear exception. I did read it in two days after all... </review>

	<review>I must admit, I had a bit of a mixed reaction to this one. On the one hand, I absolutely loved the voice of Christopher Boone, and the way Mark Haddon really got into the mind of a boy with Asperger's. It is an innocent and naive voice, yet in other ways an utterly brilliant one, throwing the world into a whole new light. I found it absolutely charming to read, and found some of Christopher's extensive knowledge on his favourite subjects quite fascinating.The story started off well for me. Christopher finds his neighbour's dog, Wellington the poodle, dead in her garden, run through with a garden fork. He sets about 'doing investigating' to find out who could commit such a terrible murder, and with the help of his aide Siobhan, writing a book about his experiences. This is that book, filled with observations and trivia, thoughts about life and the rituals and logic that make him feel safe.To my surprise, the mystery was solved sooner than expected and the story veered off on an entirely new tangent that I didn't enjoy as much. By the end the strangeness of Christopher's family situation had lost me a little; where I should have felt for him and his courageous struggle to set everything straight, I felt only a vague kind of sympathy. I wasn't as moved or stirred as I thought Haddon probably intended me to be. Not a keeper for me, but nevertheless I really enjoyed it and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to any of the, hmmm, ten people in the world who haven't read it yet! </review>

	<review>I'm not sure how to feel about this one. In brief, it's about 15-year-old Christopher Boone's attempts to discover who killed his neighbor's dog, and he learns some surprising things about his mother along the way. Though it's never mentioned explicitly, one assumes he has a form of autism. And while I've heard this book is supposed to be a real eye-opener and help people be more understanding of autistic people, I honestly developed far more sympathy for Christopher's parents. I don't know if I could handle taking care of someone like that. My hat's off to all the parents, teachers, and other caretakers who work with special needs kids every day. You are truly amazing people. </review>

	<review>A definite page-turner - I flew across the Atlantic and was so drawn into this book that I had to finish it before I went to bed, despite being jetlagged.  It is the narrator's point of view that makes it so very compelling - the author handles writing the voice of an autistic boy with a great deal of grace and sensitivity. </review>

	<review>Completely different than anything I've ever read, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon is told in the perspective of an autistic boy. I didn't know it was a young adult book until a participant in my book club last night mentioned it, and honestly I'm not sure how much a teen would get out of this book. I, however, was impressed by the way the author was able to completely portray the life of an autistic--although, highly functional autistic--boy. The main character, Christopher, is fifteen and two of his main interests are dogs and "maths", so when he finds his neighbor's dog murdered, he decides he has to solve the mystery and find the killer. The story is then a first person narrative of his experience with this great mystery, as well as a story of his overall day-to-day life.Christopher is very logical and matter-of-fact and has a difficult time understanding emotions. He doesn't like to be touched, therefore his mother and father can't even hug him without a screaming episode. This makes a reader wonder whether Christopher can really experience love at all. He seems to connect most with his teacher, Siobhan, and is always remembering advice she has given him.There is much more to the story then the mystery of the dog's killer and I won't ruin that here. Although I haven't been exposed to anyone that has autism, I feel like I have been now. I was intrgued with the clever pieces of the plot Haddon was able to work in to make this book believable. And did I mention the book has pictures? And it ends with a math problem. Talk about unique. </review>

	<review>Few authors have written so impressive a work in first person narrative. Though I don't know anyone personally with autism, the voice of the deeply touching protagonist of this book made me feel as though I did, and that by the end of the book, I understood that person so much better than any scientific article could have made me feel. I read this a couple of years ago, and it is definitely on my to re-read list. </review>

	<review>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon is a story about Christopher Boone, an autistic child, with a gift for geography, science and "maths". He also seems to have a gift of curiosity. The book begins with the killing of a neighbors dog. Christopher decides to solve the killing by finding the killer. He also discovers letters from his mother whom he had been led to believe was dead. And he finds his way to his mother's flat in spite of his many short commings.The book is written in the first person--Christopher being the story teller. I am certain this presented many difficulties and challenges for the author. Additionally it is filled with math problems and solutions which result from Christopher's need to create for himself a safe world. These and other insights into the mind of the child, Christopher, lend themselves to an interesting reading adventure.All-in-all an entertaining afternoon read. </review>

	<review>I adored this book. Having had some experience with people affected by autism and Asperger's Syndrome, I found this book compelling from a narrative perspective, but also, and most especially, from the matter-of-factness with which the characteristics of autism are explained. This gave me a good deal of insight into the reactions of autistic and Asperger's-affected persons to certain kinds of stimuli and the ways in which they approach information. If this had been the only worthwhile aspect of the book, I'd have been okay with that, but the story itself was really engaging. </review>

	<review>No, I didn't like this. I'll admit to a little prejudice just because of its unaccountable popularity. Are people reading it and liking it because the sentences are easy to read? They are easy to read because the narrator is autistic but how authentic is the author being in delivering this? I have had some first hand experience of autism and I don't particularly recognise the voice but then again autism is a broad spectrum. It doesn't feel to me that Mark Haddon has pulled off any kind of remarkable feat here. Is the apparent lack of depth a real lack of depth? It looks like blancmange and tastes like blancmange. Even the twee title annoys me. </review>

	<review>At first, I thought the main character in this book must be a very young boy, maybe seven-or eight-years-old. Then I though he has some learning difficulties. Finally I realized the boy is living with autism. For that, kudos to the author for a well-crafted book. It's smart and inquisitive and provides insight into autism without being condescending or coy. The boy has his eccentricities-- he doesn't like the colors brown or yellow, being touched, or going off of a schedule-- but he also enjoys and excels at math, "detecting," and has a close relationship with his father (although he's 15 and one worries how things will change down the road when his father gets older and can no longer care for him at the level he now does). An enjoyable read. </review>

	<review>I loved this story because of its uniqueness. It's told from the point of view of Christopher, a boy with autism, as he tries to solve the murder-mystery of his neighbor's dog. What do we learn along the way?* why 5 red cars means a Quite Good Day and yellow in any form always means a bad day* how to find the dinosaur constellation* how to show someone you love them without giving them a hugChristopher also loves prime numbers, which is why each chapter is given a prime number starting with 2 and ending at 233. I think we all feel we are a little autistic at times, so this detail made me laugh at myself throughout the story. (For whatever reason) when I am in charge of the volume, I never turn it to a prime number. If I was Christopher's mom I'd have to change my divisible number loving ways.Mark Haddon tells a touching story about family, while opening eyes to the beauty of every mind. And it's illustrated. </review>

	<review>Tijdens het lezen van dit boek dacht ik vaak aan Philippe Claudel’s “Het kleine meisje van meneer Linh”. Hier gaat het over de aan een vorm van autisme lijdende jongen Christopher, door wiens ogen we een aantal dramatische gebeurtenissen volgen, die hij zelf in gang zet door zijn besluit de moord op de hond van de buurvrouw op te lossen.Het verhaal heeft vaart èn veel zijpaadjes, waarop de wiskundig zeer begaafde Christopher ons de werking van de (zijn) wereld uitlegt. Op spannende momenten komt er zo’n zijpaadje. Vaak wordt ik dan ongeduldig, maar in dit boek niet. Dat lijkt wel op Christopher zelf, die op momenten van grote stress zijn rust terugkrijgt door zich af te sluiten en ingewikkelde wiskundige vraagstukken op te lossen, ja je wordt een beetje Christopher. Met soms veel humor brengt Haddon iemand met een geheel anders werkende psyche zo dichtbij, met het besef van de genadeloosheid van zijn situatie, voor hemzelf en voor de mensen die van hem houden.Meer dan de moord wordt uiteindelijk opgelost in dit prachtige en spannende boek. </review>

	<review>This really is a classic novel. This murder mystery combined with the life of an extremely smart kid who faces some neurological disabilities really makes a great story. I love how the chapters are numbered by prime numbers only. This was a great book with a few surprises thrown in here and there. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a short read and a good book. </review>

	<review>Written from the point of view of an autistic 15 year old boy, Curious Incident shows readers a very unique perspective on family, relationships, trust, and taking the train to London. I fell in love with the main character, Christopher; his not-quite-perfectly logical nature, obsession with math, desire to be a detective, and bravery combine to create a personality that is simultaneously heart-warming and heart-breaking.The book is a quick read; simple sentences are used and words and ideas are expressed efficiently and clearly. As narrator, Christopher does not pontificate needlessly on the veins of a leaf on a tree. In fact, he only includes descriptions because his teacher told him to.The world is a difficult place for Christopher. He desires nothing more than to be left alone. Readers can feel his frustration with adults who want to talk all the time and yet never say what they mean. But I can also feel the frustration of the adults Christopher comes into contact with. The difficulty of autism exists on both sides of the spectrum, and Haddon did a wonderful job, in my opinion, of expressing that difficulty - the opposing desires of the two sides, the inability to communicate effectively with each other. I felt for Christopher, and for his parents and neighbors. I would highly recommend this book. </review>

	<review>Christopher, he narrator and main character of this short novel, is 15 years old and a high-functioning autistic. Of course, you’re never told that outright, but it’s easy enough to deduce from the narrative style, Christopher’s behavior and the circumstances of his life (special school and so on). What’s remarkable about this book, though, it that it’s not about a boy with autism. It’s a bout a mystery that begins with the discovery of a murdered dog in a neighborhood garden, and as the story unfolds, we learn about what it must be like to live with autism—to not fathom emotion, to think with inescapable logic about everything, to be unable to deal with too much of the world at once. As readers, we grow to understand and empathize with Christopher, but never to pity him, because the story is never allowed to degenerate into maudlin sentimentality. Instead, it is told with objective straightforwardness that is sometimes ruthless, allowing a rare, engaging and ultimately affirming glimpse into an alien world – ours, as seen through the eyes of an autistic. </review>

	<review>I have to say I immensely enjoyed this book. A co-worker today told she enjoyed it as well but that she had to look beyond the hype. I guess this is true. The narrator of this story is fifteen-year-old Christopher who happens to have Asperger's which is a form of autism. One of Christopher's teachers thought it would be a good idea if Christopher wrote in a notebook and essentially wrote a "book". So like any good book, Christopher's story starts out with the "murder" of the next door neighbor's dog. As Christopher tries to solve this mystery, truths and lies are uncovered.What I really liked about this book is that Christopher is essentially a brilliant child. His mind thinks insanely logically and mathematically. Truly, his mind is like a computer. But it sometimes works against him. There is a scene where he is in a new public place and he freaks out. Because his mind and memory stores every tiny detail, it can be overwhelmed in a new location and his body just shuts down. So his story is an amazing account of how he views the world, sees things happen, interprets them, and how it affects the people around him.Because this is book is a piece of fiction...Christopher is not real...I can see how some people might not like this book. But I don't think the author was trying to imply that EVERY person with Asperger's or autism thinks and acts like Christopher. But it is an interesting concept to look at the world through different eyes. Because while reading Christopher's story, I often thought to myself...well, that makes sense. Perhaps that's not how I think but that makes sense how Christopher came to that conclusion. So I guess that's why I liked it...because it allowed me to see the world differently. And I liked Christopher. </review>

	<review>This is the story of  a 15 years old autist boy, in his own point of view. When he finds out that his neighbour's dog was killed, he tries to discover who did that, but insted discovers a lot about his own life and limits. It starts as a mystery and turns to a drama.It's a very light reading, entertaining, engaging, with little points of tension. The boy's naivety, his logic way of living, and transparency are captivating. It's worth a try:  it's kind of short and very easy to read. </review>

	<review>A very quick interesting read.  I was totally engaged by the novel being told from the point of view of an high-functioning autistic teenager.  It was really interesting to get inside the head of a boy with autism.  I thought that the book could have done more with the dog murder mystery, but I guess the real mystery was Christopher own home life and his relationship with his father.  This is a good introduction to autism for high school students.  This book is definitely for adults, but older students may appreciate this novel as well. </review>

	<review>Mange har anbefalt denne boken. Jeg har selv gitt den som gave, og den havnet under juletreet mitt for et par år siden. Altså en bok jeg burde ha lest for lenge siden.Kort fortalt handler det om en autistisk gutt som rømmer hjemmefra fordi foreldrene ikke får det til å fungere. Verden raser litt sammen for autisten som tenker rent logisk uten å være i stand til å vurdere følelser. En hund er død, det var guttens far som var den sannsynlige drapsmannen. Ergo kan faren også drepe den autistiske gutten, så han må rømme. Dette er interessant, det er godt skrevet, og jeg klarer å tro på dette under gitte forutsetninger. Likevel blir jeg ikke fenget av historien. Den blir for klinisk for meg. Jeg leser, nikker på hodet og konstaterer at sånn må det være,Og så tar jeg det som et tegn på at min opplevelse er riktig når jeg hører at Mark Haddons neste bok langt fra er like bra som denne. Ergo er Mark Haddon en forfatter som ikke klarer å gjøre mennesker ut av bokstaver, han er bare flink, ikke i stand til å skape følelser ut av papir og bokstaver, og dermed kommer jeg ikke til å lese hans neste bok. Men det var en grei bok å lese noen fine dager en sommer. </review>

	<review>It's a very fast and very easy read.  It is told from a unique point of view (person with learning difficulties) and, while I have no idea how "realistic" this insight is, it certainly is believable.  It felt like it was an accurate description of an average working household that included a young man with Aspergers.There are a lot of "tangents" that the main character went off on, but this was part of the nature of his disability and made the story that much more realistic.  The story is British and, if you were not familiar with British lifestyle (i.e. townhouses versus stand alone dwellings being the norm, A-levels being university entrance exams, huge crowds in the streets during "shopping" hours in a country that doesn't stay open 24-7...), it may lose you in places because  the author doesn't attempt to clear up  any "British-isms". </review>

	<review>I found this book a little exhausting to read. The story is told from Christopher's very observant point of view. He is a 15-year-old autistic boy who enjoys math and the color red. I really enjoyed the unique point of view, but did find some parts difficult to get through. Near the end of the book, I felt like the story was dragging a little, but I was happy with the way it ended. Having worked with autistic children, I feel this book is a great way to get a glimpse into their thinking process.This book would be most appropriate for high school and above. I would not recommend this to middle school students because of the difficult themes. </review>

	<review>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night- Time is a fascinating story told from the point of view of the protagonist, Chris who happens to be an autistic savant.  Spending time in the mind of this character is a riveting experience.  The mystery Chris is trying to solve is who killed the neighbor’s dog with a garden fork. At times the mystery of the death of the dog quickly becomes a side story as Chris’s mind is sidetracked by many other happenings in his life.  Chris distracts readers with his intelligent math equations, his ideas about colors and his daily struggles.  Readers are given some ambiguous clues throughout the book not only concerning the death of the dog but also about the mysterious death of Chris’s mother.  Mark Haddon has created an intriguing story with genuine insight into the human condition. Personally, I think all individuals that work with young people should read this book. </review>

	<review>This is a very moving story, told in first person by a young man struggling with Autism.  It is his unique voice, as he tries to explain his behavior and thought processes through the challenges of everyday life, that make this story so powerful.  The reader will gain new insight into the very complex life of a person with this condition.  The premise of the story is a mystery really.  A dog has been mysteriously killed and our narrator, Christopher, is the first to find him.  Because of his often "strange" behavior, he is automatically suspected of the killing.  Christopher makes it his personal mission to find who really killed Wellington, a poodle, with a garden fork.  In spite of his father's demands that he not stick his nose in other people's business, Christopher finds his own ways to investigate the "murder."  The search for the clues to who killed Wellington, also leads Christopher to find the answers to other important questions about his life.  These answers provide him with a surprise he had never expected.  This is a touching, interesting, eye-opening story of an young man's triumph over a condition that is debilitating and cruel and his determination to set things right in his world. </review>

	<review>3 1/2 stars. It was really interesting and a quick read, but somehow I just didn't love it. The main character's voice was really engaging, but it left me wanting more. I'm not usually a happy ending kind of girl, but I wanted more for him I guess. I would recommend it, but beware of strong language. </review>

	<review>The Holmesian title first caught my eye. I love Holmes. This though isn't a Holmes book. It's Mark Haddon's speculative attempt at telling a story from the point of view of a fifteen year old boy who has some form of Autism. Whether he actually succeeds is debatable but he has made a very creditable attempt at tackling the task nevertheless. </review>

	<review>I joined a book club, and accidentally ended up with two copies of this through inattention. They've been sitting on my shelves for several months now, and I thought I'd finally give it a read, and blazed through the whole book in the space of 2.5 hours in the bath this afternoon. I don't know what to say about it really: I enjoyed it. A fairly interesting little tale, but the point of view of the narrator makes the telling more interesting. I can see why not everyone would get on with it though. </review>

	<review>Christopher, a mathematically gifted, autistic 15-year-old English boy has an overwhelming fear of interacting with people.  Still, the murder of a neighbor’s dog compels him to investigate the mystery.  He uncovers surprising things about himself and his mother in the process.  The plot of this book is less interesting than its revelations about autism.  In the hands of a less skilled and empathetic writer, the use of an autistic narrator would feel more like a stunt.  In this book, however, the challenges of autism are handled with compassion and humanity, creating an indelible and fully realized fictional character. </review>

	<review>Finding the dog with the garden fork sticking out of it really "hooked" me.  I liked the running stream-of-consciousness story-telling style that the author used to tell this story.  Christopher was scads more interesting and even a much more likable character to me than his "normal" parents.  I really felt like I was inside of Christopher's head throughout the book.  It was a truly fascinating (and sometimes terrifying) place to be.  I did have to take off one star for the headache I got trying to figure out some of the math problems! </review>

	<review>I enjoyed this book because it sincerely made me think of all the students I have worked with who happened to have Asperger syndrome. I am not a specialist or anything of the sort but Mark Haddon's narrator "Chris" really hit the nail on the head. From my limited view, it really did seem like I was reading a book written by a 15 year old boy with Aspergers. Every time I would turn a page it was like reading something written by one of these students I used to work with. The ability to write from this point of view is ultimately the greatest strength of the book. I knew going in that Mr. Haddon was going to have be very careful about how his character was going to react to situations involving human emotion. I even started looking for parts where he might have slipped up, but the illusion is complete, at least it was for me. One remarkable part of the book was the journey from Swindon to London. Given Chris' aversion to crowds and abundant stimulus, getting on a train by oneself and figuring out the subway system was obviously harrowing. Mr. Haddon truly had me stressing out over a simple train ride and subway navigation. Through Chris' eyes it really did seem quite intense. It caused me to sympathize greatly with the condition. I started to think about the things that I go through in my every day work life and how that would effect someone with Asperger Syndrome.I also enjoyed the abundant diagrams and pictorial samples that Mr. Haddon put in the book to help illustrate Chris' way of thinking. The math problems were dutifully intimidating and I loved all the science references. As an atheist I also appreciated Chris' logical take on religion and creationism. I also liked that he called out Sir Arthur Conan Doyle on his wacky spiritualism and ludicrous beliefs, like the Cottingley Faeries. Lastly, the book as a whole was written as if written by Chris which was a nice touch. The chapters are all prime numbers. Chris refers to the book as the book he is writing. His appendix is added in the background. He added bits to meet the advice of his counselor at school. I thought it added an enjoyable extra layer to the reading experience. Over all a great quick engaging read. </review>

	<review>I don't get it - I've heard such wonderful things about this book, and of course, it's included in "the list". I was so disappointed. While this view of the world by Christopher, autistic?, aspherger's?, was certainly interesting and I enjoyed reading it - in the end, it just simplified the complex relationships and issues that had been established throughout the book.   The happy endings to all of the angst struck me as ridiculous and false. </review>

	<review>I really enjoyed reading this book.  I was intrigued to read this book since I had a child with autism in my classroom this year.  The book starts off very fast getting to the introduction of the main character Christopher Boone and how he has a very gifted mind but is lacking in the area of social skills.  I think that this book's biggest strength is how it makes the reader feel as if they are inside Christopher's head and understands his thoughts and feelings as their own.  One weakness is that there is the main problem in the book ends up being very minimal compared to the other conflict that arises later in the book. </review>

	<review>Curiosa y muy interesante novela en la que el autor se mete en la personalidad de un adolescente con autismo; con un esfuerzo notable, Mark Haddon nos muestra la manera de actuar y, sobre todo, de sentir de los autistas: su rechazo al contacto, el porqué de los gemidos, su aparente frialdad, etc. Su lectura es muy recomendable para conocer mejor el fenómeno.En el aspecto literario, está bien escrita, es amena y el argumento es peculiar, aunque el final se resuelve un tanto atolondradamente. En cualquier caso, me ha gustado. </review>

	<review>I give the book 4 1/2 out of 5 stars.  I think this book is great for anyone who works with any autistic child.  It is also great for students to read so they have a better understanding of what life is like for autistic children/adults.  I think it is great to introduce to kids because they can see that their are many different kinds of autism, and may be able to help a fellow peer by understanding.  Some of the strengths were the suspense of wanting to know what is going to happen next.  The story used real experiences that kids can relate to.  If reading to a class I worry about is kids labeling all special education students and think they have the same problems.  Another weakness is the ending.  It leaves you hanging, unsure of what happened exactly. </review>

	<review>This book was like a breath of fresh air. At times hilarious, at times quite sad, it told its story flawlessly and with fearless emotion. The characters were vivid, fresh, well developed, and immensely appealing, especially the main character, Christopher John Francis Boone. He is an autistic teenager living on the outskirts of London with his father. He believes his mother to be dead, and when he discovers that he has been betrayed and lied to, he sets out on a heartrending journey to find her.Highly recommended. </review>

	<review>Haddon's novel is a startling performance. This is the sort of book that could turn condescending, or exploitative, or overly sentimental, or grossly tasteless very easily, but Haddon navigates those dangers with a sureness of touch that is extremely rare among first-time novelists. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is original, clever, and genuinely moving: this one is a must-read. --Jack Illingworth, Amazon.ca --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.</review>

	<review>Good book.  Some touching moments, but also a few things didn't mesh well for me, such as the main character saying he doesn't like books and then two or three chapters later, he is describing his favorite book.  Other than a few things like that though, the story was great.  A lot more interesting than one would think. </review>

	<review>Few things that i loved in the book The Curious incident of the dog in the night time written by Mark Haddon are They way it is written it not only brings in the suspense of what is going to happen in the next chapter, but with more so to break the monotony you have actually have diagrams, maths puzzles, maps, flowcharts, floor layouts in the novel itself. It was like asking my parents when i was introduced to novels, why arent there any pictures in this book, then they told me you automatically form and imagine the image in your mind.About the story it starts with a 15 year old boy, Christopher who is planning to give Maths Level A exams and sees the dead dog who has been murdered with garden fork and he tries to solve the mystery. While unraveling the truth, he unravels some mysteries of his own life. The other thing that i liked in the book was that the little Christopher has been very finicky in things which has been made very clear that starting with he does not like colour Yellow and Brown. If someone was under some stress or anger, normally, people would say start counting from 1 to 50(1, 2, 3, 4, ...), but Christopher's case it would start doing cubes of each number to ease out on the stress (1, 8, 27, 64, ...). This actually makes the book engaging. He relaxes by solving maths problems. Mark Haddon actually brings in the new perspective to the normal mundane things that we do, and specially when we have the maths to solve in them. But at the same time, there have been simple things as to why people are thinking, probably it is new to them are they would want to know more about it and when it comes from a thought process of 15 year old, it just seems to simple, but at the same time, when we become complicate things and being in a lot of elements at the same time, we have a lot of distractions. Example would description of the farm would be green pastures with white fence spread across 2 acres of land with 27 cows, out of which 18 white with black patches and 9 pure black cows. With such a kind of description and the maths becoming difficult, this is surely a light read, if you want to skip these problems, but at the same time for the geeks, this book is the ideal one to read. </review>

Adentrarse así en la vida cotidiana de una familia partiendo del hecho de un incidente con un perro en el vecindario, la trama y el argumento está servido.

	<review>Christopher Boone is 15 years, 3 months and 2 days old. He knows all the countries of the world and can recite their capitals. He likes animals, but he doesn't enjoy people - their facial expressions are too difficult to understand. He knows all the prime numbers up 7,057. Christopher is autistic. When Christopher decides to investigate the mysterious death of a neighbor's dog, he keeps a record of his findings, and his detection leads him in a direction he never expected. This is an astonishing book. Autism isn't something that I know a great deal about, though I have known a few people who had it, and I found it absolutely fascinating to get this peek inside an autistic mind. This is a fictional work, based on Haddon's work with autistic children, but I think it comes as close as possible to reality. The book is written in journal style, and it jumps about quite a bit as Christopher talks about prime numbers, why he doesn't like the color yellow, and why dogs are better than people. There are lots of diagrams that Christopher uses to organize his world ina way he understands. You get an inside view on the stresses of raising a child with autism and the toll it has taken on Christopher's parents, even though Christopher doesn't understand it himself. One of my favorite quotes of all time is from Marcel Proust and says "The only true voyage of discovery is not seeing new landscapes, but having new eyes. Both heartbreaking and hopeful, this book will give you new eyes. </review>

	<review>* NO SPOILERS WERE USED IN THE WRITING OF THIS REVIEW! *This slice of life from the perspective of an autistic adolescent is brilliant for several reasons, not the least of which is direct, compact and compelling writing that had me hooked from page one. It clearly illustrates how differently people actually perceive the world (most humans share a mainstream perspective, while the exceptions are labeled as "challenged" or "disabled") In reality, people who see things differently are special and important precisely BECAUSE they offer us an alternative perspective; they can show us things that we've never noticed before. Such is the case with this book's main character, Christopher, who muses that most people don't really notice very much at all.Despite his challenges, Christopher is an extremely bright character, and offers fascinating philosophical commentary on the nature of the universe, religion, and society.  Reading this book, which was originally intended for young adults, gave me ample food for thought and reflection. In fact, I wished several times that I knew someone like Christopher and could actually have a conversation with him, because there were so many philosophical ideas that I would love to discuss and get his opinion on. Its fascinating that out of the myriad books I've read over the course of my life, this is the first time I can remember wanting to meet one of the characters in real life! </review>

	<review>The premise: Christopher Boone is 15 years, 3 months, and 2 days old, and he's autistic. When he's caught next to the neighbor's murdered dog and is arrested, he makes it his mission to find out who did it and why, even though every one he knows is telling him to mind his own business, including his father. The story that follows is more than a simple murder mystery, one that shows some of the ugly realities of human life and how those realities relate to an autistic teenager, especially one who, while very smart, can't always interpret the clues for what they really mean.My RatingGive It Away: I liked it well enough, and really, there's nothing I found distracting or frustrating with the book, but it's not something that grabbed me, nor is it a book I'll want around to read again. I think it's symptomatic of the fact I've read books featuring autistic narrators before, so if I was looking for any sort of surprise, this book failed to deliver, and that's not the author's fault. I'm sure this book will wow readers who haven't read what I have (Elizabeth Moon's The Speed of Dark), but who are curious about the mind of an autistic boy. He's not a sympathetic narrator, mind you, but his matter-of-fact way of looking at things keeps the pages turning, even though it keeps you somewhat emotionally distant from the story. The mystery is pretty simple to solve, and even the twist isn't much of a twist if you're paying attention, and since all of this happens toward the middle of the book, you've got a way to go to the end. I figured out the actions easily enough, but in terms of drawing to a close, it takes a while and then happens too fast, if that makes sense. Some stuff takes longer than necessary, while stuff that should be given more time happen too fast. Still, it's a decent book that I'm glad I've read. It just won't be sticking around. The full review, which is full of spoilers, may be found in my LJ. As always, comments and discussion are most welcome.REVIEW: Mark Haddon's THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIMEHappy Reading! </review>

	<review>This book purports to give you a glimpse of the world through the eyes of an autistic teenager.  You could empathise with both he and his parents, and for me this was its real strength.  It was clever and poignant, and although the novelty of its style wore thin with me at times, overall I found this original, thought-provoking, and skilfully written. </review>

	<review>This book was really cool to read because the writing style was so much different than what I am used to reading. I usually read stuff with metaphors and things like that, but this book is written so literally that you can really understand everything that's going on exactly. I actually really liked this book. The insane things that the character does and finds normal are actually quite funny. Overall, this book was enjoyable to read, but not a LOL book. </review>

	<review>An intense and engrossing book, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, is a fantastic read. Haddon's words let you into Christopher's mind and world as he struggles to navigate through day to day life. Sometimes being in his mind was so overwhelming, I had to put the book down for a few hours or even a day. My heart went out to Christopher's parents, two people just trying to love and take care of a boy they can't even touch, as their adult lives spin out of control. I would highly recommend this book, the characters are interesting, the plot moves quickly, and I was left with a better understand of what it means to be autistic. </review>

	<review>Christopher Boone has one goal and that is to find out who the murderer of a neighborhood dog (Wellington) is. Although his search is for a dog-murderer, Christopher's quest ultimately uncovers some very important family secrets along the way.It was fascinating to be able to read thru the point-of-view of an 11 year old child with autism - it definitely made for a compelling read. I loved reading about all the quirks (i.e. his hate of anything yellow or brown, his pain at being touched, how a certain amount of red cars or yellow cars would determine how his day went, how doing "maths" calms him down, etc.). Along the way, you also learn about his daily interactions with his father, teachers and neighbors. This story provides great insight to those who want to understand what autism is. Most books revolve around people who care for an autistic person and I found this to be a fresh and profound view of living with autism. It was a quick and enjoyable read and an altogether great experience for the insight it provides. </review>

	<review>Brilliant!  I particularly enjoy reading books that are vastly different from anything else I've read - and this certainly fits that category.  It was fascinating - not nearly sufficient enough of a word, but it will do - to read from the perspective of an autistic protagonist.  The author impressively created a charming little novel filled with humour and warmth - emotions that our main character could not feel, himself.  An easy read - although as a warning to the more sensitive that it does contain bad language.  This is a book I definitely recommend. </review>

Wonderfully insightful into the social issues facing those at the Aspergers end of the Autistic Spectrum Disorders. I laughed, I cried and felt many more emotions in between. </review>

	<review>So, I think differently? Is that bad? Does ‘different’ thinking present problems needing cataloging by those who claim to ‘think alike?’ Did no one think completely ‘differently’ through the Paths, Shadows, Caves and Forests of Evolution? It is odd to think of how closely we are allowed to think in a different way from the perceived norm of everyday people before we are labeled ‘too different.’ George Carlin once pointed out the driver who speeds by him is a lunatic and the one going too slowly in front of him is just plain crazy!This Book will take you in thought places you haven’t gone. Quickly the puzzle of words, diagrams, absolute findings and ramifications will entice your own mind. You will be challenged to place values, opinions and attitudes upon people, places, rules, lines and structure as you have not been before. Too much work? Not really. Amusing and heart wrenching the reader begins to tip-toe through the constructs of the main character’s mind fields as well as their own. Franque </review>

	<review>" Mrs. Peters's husband is a vicar called the Reverend Peters, and he comes to our school sometime to talk to us, and I asked him where heaven was, and he said, "It's not in our universe. It's a different kind of place altogether." The Reverend Peters makes a funny ticking noise sometimes with his tongue when he is thinking. And he smokes cigarettes and you can smell them on his breath and I don't like this.I said that there wasn't anything outside the universe and there wasn't another kind of place altogether. Except that there might be if you went through a black hole, but a black hole is what is called a  singularity,  which means it is impossible to find out what is on the other side because the gravity of a black hole is so big that even electromagnetic waves like light can't get out of it, and electromagnetic waves are how we get information about things that are far away.  And if heaven was on the other side of a black hole, people would have to be fired into space on rockets to get there and they aren't or people would notice. I think people believe in heaven because they don't like the idea of dying, because they won't to carry on living and don't like the idea that other people will move into their house and put their things into the rubbish."Meet 15-year old Christopher Boone, a kid with Asperger's Syndrome whose dream is to become an astronaut. Christopher likes maths and science and puzzles. And he also likes animals. So when his neighbour's dog is killed he goes on a quest to find out who did it. It's hard being a detective when you have difficulties communicating with people, and a dozen other "behavioral problems" but Christopher does it anyway; and when he finds out who the murderer is, the revelations that follow turn his world upside down.That's pretty much the storyline. I had no idea what rating I would give the book. While I was reading it I knew I was enjoying it very much: Christopher's little rants about maths puzzles, about the universe, about the inexplicable behaviour of his fellow humans, and about himself are lovely. Even now I find myself thinking about them and quoting them very often. But at the same time I didn't get the feeling that I was reading a great book. I think that has a lot to do with the writing. In Haddon's attempt to portray Christopher as realistically as possible, he makes him employ a simple, logical, undemanding and unsentimental language - which is indeed very effective in creating the impression that we're actually in Christopher's head. The problem with this, however, is that even after having read the book I still can't tell if Haddon is a good or a bad writer. On the one hand I cannot say the writing is beautiful - sometimes the book feels like reading a science book and sometimes like a teenager's diary. On the other hand, that is after all, the effect the author was trying to create: that the novel is written by a science-obsessed teenager with certain behavioral issues who views the world very logically. I must say I would be very curious to read something else by Haddon, if only to see how his writing differs from this book. That said, I did enjoy this one quite a bit and I think it is definitely worth the very short time it will take you to read it. </review>

	<review>I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and felt an affection for Christopher Boone that surprised me.  He's quirky, as Asperger's Syndrome people are, and his personality resonates throughout the book.  His persistence with trying to solve the mystery of the murder of his neighbor's dog is charming and witty.  Of course the side story about his mom's death holds the whole story together, and the ending is wonderful. </review>

	<review>This was an interesting read for anyone who has ever had an interest in special needs people. The writing draws you in quickly because it is so different from the typical novel. The characters are all intriguing, but I admit to just scanning over a few passages because the book became repetitive. I was a good read, but I was glad that it was fairly short. </review>

	<review>I loved this book.  I had no idea what it was about and it sucked me right in.  This is told from the perspective of a 12 year old boy who is severely autistic.  It has a very real feel to it and I kept thinking it was a true story.  Lots of charts and diagrams from the boy who is also a Savant in Mathematics.  Alters your reality and really makes you view things from another point of view.  Delightful! Quick Read. </review>

	<review>One of the books I have read in my "Modern Winners" category of my 999 challenge and it is quite easy to see why this book did win the Whitbread Book of the Year prize. The idea of having, perhaps the unlikliest person in fiction who fantasies of being the only person left alive and abhors human company and contact, narrate this book seems a bold step but it works and he gives us an insight into human behaviour that no-one else can. This idea of the outsider looking in reminded me of Camus' Mersault in his book The Stranger but whereas perhaps Mersault saw and was only looking for the despair around him the narrator here, Christopher Boone, sees the world and the people around him impassively without any involvment from himself. As he himself says at the start, he cannot tell lies, not because he is a good person but he simply does not know how to lie and so everything that happens to him as he tells it is true without any judgment and this seems to include the police happy to see a 15 stand in a trance for hours at a local railway station, to have no parents accompanying him, though he admits to having his father's cashpoint card and starngers walking off disgusted with him after he has narrowly escaped death on the lines of the underground in London!The book starts, as it says on the cover, with christopher investigating the curious incident of the dog at night time. I'm giving nothing away by saying this curious incident is the death of the dog across the street from Christopher, but Mark merely uses this as a starting point, a way of introducing the people and events necessary to send Cristopher, who cannot live and does not want to live in a world full of people, on a journey into the unknown on his own. The story developed in a way I had not expected at all, having red reviews and had friends recommend this to me I was still very surprised by the second half of the novel but when I finished I realised that nothing else could have happened in  its place. It's a very fast paced book with short chapters in an almost diary-like fashion and, despite what Christopher says at the start about him not having a sense of humour or knowing any jokes, it is very funny as well.I would certainly recommend this book to people and I greatly enjoyed reading it which gives it 3 stars, it misses out on 4 stars simply because I do not think I would ever re-read the story. </review>

	<review>El curioso incidente del perro a medianoche es una novela que no se parece a ninguna otra. Elogiada con entusiasmo por autores consagrados como Oliver Sacks e Ian McEwan, ha merecido la aprobación masiva de los lectores en todos los países donde se ha publicado, además de galardones como el Premio Whitbread y el Premio de la Commonwealth al Mejor Primer Libro. Su protagonista, Christopher Boone, es uno de los más originales que han surgido en el panorama de la narrativa internacional en los últimos años, y está destinado a convertirse en un héroe literario universal de la talla de Oliver Twist y Holden Caulfield. A sus quince años, Christopher conoce las capitales de todos los países del mundo, puede explicar la teoría de la relatividad y recitar los números primos hasta el 7.507, pero le cuesta relacionarse con otros seres humanos. Le gustan las listas, los esquemas y la verdad, pero odia el amarillo, el marrón y el contacto físico. Si bien nunca ha ido solo más allá de la tienda de la esquina, la noche que el perro de una vecina aparece atravesado por un horcón, Christopher decide iniciar la búsqueda del culpable. Emulando a su admirado Sherlock Holmes —el modelo de detective obsesionado con el análisis de los hechos—, sus pesquisas lo llevarán a cuestionar el sentido común de los adultos que lo rodean y a desvelar algunos secretos familiares que pondrán patas arriba su ordenado y seguro mundo. </review>

	<review>I quite enjoyed this book, even if I did like the writing better than the plot itself. I liked getting inside Christopher's mind, and dear god he reminded me of myself at times. Food touching other food, nope not allowed!"I think prime numbers are like life. They are very logical but you could never work out the rules, even if you spent all your time thinking abou them." Indeed. 100% Agreed. Applies to understanding Japanese culture as well :-DHe also reminds me a lot of the class at the school where mom used to be principal. Dear god did they go freaky if anything was moved.The ending...Not so much. Already knew about it since someone had spoiled it for me but it just seemed a total non-sequitur. </review>

	<review>I received this one from SantaThing, and read it quickly.  I can't say what people with autism actually think and feel, so I can only hope that Haddon's experience working with them gave him an accurate idea of this, as I expect a great many people will be taking their main conceptualizations of autism from this book.What I do know, however, is that this novel is a cleanly written and forceful essay on seeing and not seeing, understanding and not understanding.  Haddon's Christopher notices precious things we often overlook, and struggles with precious things we take for granted.  Both of these differences remind us to look around us with new eyes.Highly recommended. </review>

	<review>This book gives a lot of valuable insight into an autistic boy's mind, but at the same time Christopher was really way mature for his age, which felt incongruent to me.  No 15-year-old narrator should sound like that. I give it 5 stars for its original voice but 3 for the unoriginal and less-than-believable story. 3 stars because it was such a damn easy read. </review>

	<review>Mark Haddon set himself quite a task with his debut novel, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.  Not only did he choose to tell his story from the point of view of his autistic 15-year-old protagonist, but the story was also a murder mystery, with all the constraints and limitations that genre imposes. And, as all the accolades have since proven, Haddon pulled it off brilliantly.The novel is the story of Christopher John Francis Boone and his investigation of the suspicious death of Wellington, a neighbor's dog. He comes upon the dead pet late one night, and is at first accused of committing the crime himself. But once that mix-up is straightened out, he decides to conduct his investigation (in spite of the police "caution" and his father's admonitions) and write up his findings as a mystery novel – just like his favorite book, The Hound of the Baskervilles, and just like Sherlock Holmes, the detective he admires. Along the way, however, Christopher manages to uncover some disturbing secrets relating as much to himself and his family as they do to the murdered poodle.This is an amazing book – and it's very much Christopher's story; most of the other characters are shadowy presences on the perimeters of his world.  Fortunately, Christopher is a wonderfully complex creation. Although he attends a "special needs" school, he is a genius at mathematics. He has total recall and can draw maps from memory.  He knows "all the countries of the world and their capital cities and every prime number up to 7,057" – he has chosen to give his chapters prime numbers instead of the usual cardinal numbers, because he likes prime numbers. He can't stand to be touched, and too much noise or commotion sends him into a panic. He hates the color yellow. In conversation, he's very literal and can't really engage in small talk or "chat." And while he relates perfectly to animals (he was very fond of Wellington, and he keeps a pet rat named Toby), he is almost completely without understanding of human emotions. Very much like his hero Holmes.And, also like Holmes, even with all his problems, Christopher emerges at the end of the book as a very sympathetic, engaging individual. He knows he has limitations, and yet he's also very determined and self-reliant. He even displays a strangely appealing sort of wittiness. Though more than a bit off-center, of course. He's one of those characters who make you feel they're going right on with their lives after you close the book on them. </review>

	<review>I'm not sure why I picked this book up.  Perhaps it was the interesting cover that first grabbed my attention.  Reading the cover notes, it sounded interesting enough.  In a nutshell, Christopher, an autistic boy investigates the murder of the neighbors dog and writes a book to tell his story.  This book is that book.  An interesting concept and in fact Mark Haddon pulls it off quite well.  I completely believe that this book was written by an autistic child.  That is also where it fails for me.  After the first few chapters it got old.  I'm sure this is exactly how it would be written if it were true, but goodness, the side paths that are taken just get old before too long.  Many times I just wanted to put his one down, but it was short so I finished, though I did skip over paragraphs and whole chapters when it went off story.  Some people may really enjoy this, but it's just not my style. </review>

	<review>This is an excellent book. Narrated from the perspective of 15-year old Christopher Boone, it follows his attempts to uncover the mystery of who murdered his next-door neighbour's dog.Christopher, however, suffers from Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism that gives him a photographic memory and an incredible grasp of mathematics and science, but leaves him unable to understand human beings: their emotions, society, relationships and expressions. He lives with his father and attends a school for mentally disabled children, living a life which most people would find tediously restricting, but which Christopher is perfectly happy with. The murder of his neighbour's dog, however, sparks off a chain of events that reveal the sad, dark secrets of his family, which he finds quite difficult to deal with.Naturally the language is very simple, but Christopher's thought patterns are intriguing enough to keep the book gripping; I read the first two thirds in a single sitting after midnight. While Christopher's way of speaking may be quite bland, the things he speaks about are anything but:For a long time, scientists were puzzled about how the sky is dark at night, even though there are billions of stars in the universe and there must be stars in every direction you look, so the sky should be full of starlight because there is very little in the way to stop the light reaching earth.Then they worked out that the universe was expanding, that the stars were all rushing away from one another after the Big Bang, and the further the stars were away from us the faster they were moving, some of them nearly as fast as the speed of light, which was why their light never reached us... And when the universe has finished exploding all the stars will slow down, like a ball that has been thrown into the air, and they will come to a halt and they will all begin to fall towards the centre of the universe again. And then there will be nothing to stop us seeing all the stars in the world because they will all be moving towards us, gradually faster and faster, and we will know that the world is going to end soon because when we look up into the sky at night there will be no darkness, just the blazing light of billions and billions of stars, all falling.Except that no one will see this because there will be no people left on earth to see it. They will probably have become extinct by then. And even if there are people still in existence they will not see it because the light will be so bright and hot that everyone will be burnt to death, even if they live in tunnels.Christopher has a matter-of-fact approach to everything, and learning how his mind works, while usually fascinating, is also sad. Towards the end of the book he details his favourite recurring dream, in which everyone in the world except himself has died, and he can be alone and do whatever he wants. Nothing would make him happier.Some of the most emotional scenes in the book revolve around Christopher's loved ones. His father, Ed Boone, is the most well developed character in the story after Christopher himself. His life has had immense strain placed on it because of Christopher's autism, and while he is usually doting and caring, making immense sacrifices, some of his actions could be considered horrific or downright evil. Nonetheless, I found myself respecting him as a truly honourable man - somebody who has been pushed to breaking point and reacted with excruciating grief and anger, in direct contrast to his son's complete neutrality and logical outlook on everything. I doubt any reader could say they wouldn't react in a similar, if not worse way. I know very little about autism, and while I'm not naive enough to assume that reading this book would make anyone an expert (indeed, some real experts are quite critical of the manner in which it is portrayed), it serves as an entertaining reminder that even people who don't quite fit into our society are still human, in their own way. </review>

	<review>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is very interesting, original and strangely enjoyable. A pretend detective story by a young boy with Aspergers Syndrome. His psychological difficulties are delineated and are heartbreakingly sad. He is a maths genius but is unable to cope with life. A quick read. </review>

	<review>Here is the first entry for the From the Stacks Reading Challenge that I am participating in. I have chosen my list of books which include this one, as well as Dragons of the Dwarven Depths (Margaret Weis  Tracy Hickman), Crimes Against Nature (Robert F Kennedy), Under the Net (Iris Murdoch), and Life of Pi (Yann Martel). Kind of a random selection, but I have so many to choose from, I went with books that were gifts. I always feel bad when I get books as gifts, and then next time I see the person who gave it to me, they ask about it and I have yet to read it. This will take care of a couple of those.I have heard so much about this book, but it took this challenge to get me to read it. After the first ten pages or so, I knew that I was going to love it. I actually had no idea what it was even about, so I had no preconceived notions whatsoever. The main character is Christopher, a fifteen-year-old autistic boy who is also a genius when it comes to math and logical thinking. He has developed ways of understanding his world that allow him to adequately function on his own, but new situations are still terrifying for him. He has no real concept of human emotions, and he lacks understanding when it comes to many types of communication. Everything is very literal for him, making most people difficult for him to comprehend. He lives with his father, who knows him very well, and he goes to a school with other special needs children, where his main teacher understands exactly how he needs to be taught. Even with his difficulties, his life works very well, until the night he finds his neighbor's dog dead in its yard. Christopher decides to become a detective like one of his heroes, Sherlock Holmes, and find out who killed Wellington (the dog did not simply die of natural causes). This investigation exposes more truths than Christopher is capable of handling, and the choices he makes to try to set his world right change his life forever.The story is told in first-person narrative, in Christopher's voice. It is brilliant, Mark Haddon does an amazing job of putting the reader into Christopher's mind. Within the first couple of pages, I loved him, and learning about the way he thinks and perceives the world was fascinating. Christopher has worked very hard to develop ways of interacting with the world that will help him to feel safe, and when those controls fall away, seeing how he acts is frightening, because you come to fear for him and his well-being. This is a tremendous book, and shows that no matter what problems we face in our own lives, if we do our best and face the problems head on, we can do anything. </review>

	<review>This book is a very easy read - it took me two days, and if I'd had two hours together, that's all it would have taken. I would have done too, because the story just reaches out and pulls you in. You find yourself inside the mind of an autistic boy, but able to read the signals in the people around him that he can't, and this makes for a compelling mixture, leaving you desperate to find out how things are going to work out for him and his stressed, confused and [mostly] well-meaning parents. A great book - really looking forward to Mark Haddon's next release. </review>

	<review>Haddon's novel takes us into the mind of Christopher, an adolescent boy with autism.  The plot revolves around Christopher's decision to solve the mystery of who killed his neighbor's dog.  His sleuthing uncovers some startling secrets and truths about his own family.  Haddon's writing style reflects the peculiarities of Christopher's rituals and thought processes in a way that makes sense to the reader.  One can see the situation through Christopher's eyes, and also imagine that they understand the other side of the story (the father's, often) which Christopher isn't always able to grasp.  The result is a touching story about family and how we express love for one another.  In my opinion, this book is appropriate for older YA reader's, as it hints at some mature themes such as adult relationships, sex, and violence.  I would recommend it for a public library YA collection. </review>

	<review>I loved this book! I really enjoyed it and thought it was an excellent book. At times I was really moved by it and got teary-eyed. Such a unique perspective of an autistic boy, his broken family, life's lessons and coping and dealing with them. A short read, but very well done and original. http://ktleyed.blogspot.com/2008/09/c... </review>

	<review>Genre: Realistic fictionAge Appropriateness: Middle SchoolReview: This book is a good example of realistic fiction because the narrative presents a true depiction of life from an autistic boy, Christopher's perspective.  Christopher has a photographic memory and understands math and science, but not human beings.  When he finds his neighbor’s dog dead in the lawn, he tries to find the killer. However, while solving the mystery he finds out that his mother is not dead and his dad killed the dog. In this whirl of discoveries, Christopher is tested to the end and has to decide whom to trust. Plot: This book is a good example of person against person because Christopher's trust between his fathers is broken because he kills the dog. Through this story, Christopher experiences several dilemmas between neighbors, parents, and other strangers. The author did a good job engaging the readers because the plot had problems that needed to be solved between the characters.</review>

	<review>Christopher, a 15 year old, has many disorders found in the Autism spectrum; the entire book is written from his point of view.  He discovers the neighbor's dog impaled on a garden fork and goes on a vendetta to find the murderer.  His parents are experiencing even more problems than Christopher, and mainly because of him, thereby leaving him to figure out life on his own except for some mentoring by an instructional assistant at school.  This book is an excellent way to better understand the whys and wherefores of teens with this disability.  Newest on my list of must-reads. </review>

	<review>The story of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is interesting and moving, but it is ultimately secondary to author Mark Haddon’s intelligent, inventive, utterly unique narrative technique. In Christopher’s stream-of-consciousness writing, Haddon gives a voice to autistic children and tells a story that is not only entertaining but insightful and informative. Before he became a writer, Haddon worked with children with autism, and that knowledge and experience is evident within the text and is a key feature of its intelligence and accessibility.In the way that Christopher takes everything literally and approaches life with a mindset that is both incredibly concrete and remarkably abstract, we are able to see the world and social conventions through the eyes of an outsider, and we are invited to think about them in a new way. This is a tricky feat to pull off, and Haddon makes it look easy.I have no idea why it took me so long to get around to reading The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. I’ve been hearing wonderful things about it for years, and now I know why.  This was a fantastic book, and its length and quick pace made it an ideal one sitting read. I’d recommend it to anyone who is interested in autism and education or who is just looking for a good read.Full review at  The Book Lady's Blog.  </review>

	<review>Age Appropriateness: Middle School Genre: Fiction Media: NoneCharactarization: Christopher is a round and dynamic character. The entire book is devoted to how Christopher thinks and lives his life. After every new page the reader learns something new about Christopher and by the end of the book the reader has a good idea of who Chrisopher is and how he opperates. Christopher is also a dynamic character because he develops throughout the situations that occur in his life. He learns how to deal with the lies told by his father and learns to fight through the struggles he has on a day to day basis.Review: This is a good example of fiction because the story is believeable and seems real while reading it. Christopher is a 15 year old boy dealing with the divorce of his parents and his stuggles as a child with a photographic memory and so much more. </review>

	<review>This book came so highly recommended that I didn't take the time to research it.   The story just didn't captivate me.   I thought that the book was written by a boy with Aspergers, but instead it was a work of fiction written by Mark Haddon.   I was disappointed after hearing everyone rave.  I am sorry that I gave the time!   Too many books, much too little time! </review>

	<review>This book is so well written.  Though we will never know what it is truly like to see the world from the perspective of someone with autism, this point of view surely seems like as close as we'll get.In the novel, Christopher, an autistic boy, decides to solve the murder of his neighbor's dog.  The investigation takes him places he never dreamed of and takes him closer to the heart of his family than he ever knew existed.  His mathematical interludes and his explanations make any reader's heart go out to him.The style makes it a fast and yet incredibly enlightening read.  I never knew so much could be revealed in so few words. </review>

	<review>I often worry that these books with a lot of buzz won’t live up to the hype by the time I get around to reading them.  In this case, I shouldn’t have worried. From his prime-numbered chapters to his reasons why he doesn’t like the colors yellow and brown, Haddon’s autistic narrator is full of his own charm, even if he couldn’t tell you what charm was.  You can’t help but feel for this boy who wants to find out who killed his neighbor’s dog, thinks his mother is dead, and lacks the filter we take for granted to see and hear only that which is important to us. From time to time you may get bogged down in Christopher’s factual digressions and descriptions, but it’s not long before you’re caught back up in his story. </review>

	<review>Very Interesting book told from the POV of a 15 year old Autistic boy.  He is very bright and thoughtful, and struggles to deal with and understand humans and their actions.  He has issues with color, textures, too much of anything too fast, emotions, strangers and expressing emotion, specifically touching.    Yet he also has strengths math, science, and logic.  He has a good heart and he knows his deficits and tries to fit in and not cause problems, when he is given time and space. He also has grown and can reflect back on when he was less able to fit it.  He has dreams and aspirations for the future.The story starts with the murder of a neighborhood dog, and progresses to the unraveling of his comfy life, which turns out to be a lie.  He struggles to come to terms with the imperfections of humanity, since he prefers the neat world of math and science.It was a fun read, and quite gripping.  It was sad to leave him at the end, even though it is a short book it was emotionally wrenching. </review>

	<review>What is unique about this story is how the narrator, a 15-year old autistic boy, tells it. It is a very interesting perspective and the narrator stays in character the whole way. Some of the other characters outside of the protoganist didn't ring completely true, but in general, the whole thing worked very well for me. Highly recommended. </review>

	<review>Haddon's choice to view the world through an autistic first-person narrator yields some rewards, particularly in exploring the yearning for a world with more clearly discernable mathematical structure. But in the end the exercise continues for a little too long, to diminishing returns.It's worth checking out for the brief riffs on the Monty Hall problem, the logistic growth population model, and Conway's soldiers, even if you don't read the whole thing. </review>

	<review>15 årige Christopher lider av Aspergers syndrom, en mild form for autisme. En dag finner han naboens hund stukket ihel av en høygaffel. Han bestemmer seg for å etterforske drapet i god Sherlock Holmes-stil, samtidig som han skriver bok om det han opplever og tenker. Under etterforskningen kommer han også over opplysninger som kaster et nytt lys over det som skjedde med moren to år tidligere.  Christopher er en meget intelligent gutt. Han har bl.a. store evner innen matematikk. Hver gang han overveldes av sanseinntrykk fra omverdenen, finner han trygghet i å løse kompliserte matematikk-oppgaver. For å få kontroll over tilværelsen gjør han alt han kan for å sortere inntrykkene og gjøre dem begripelige og håndterlige. Siden han verken forstår ironi, metaforer eller klarer å lese andres ansikter og følelser, sliter han mer enn de fleste. Dette med mellommenneskelige relasjoner får han ikke til. Denne boka var bare helt skjønn! Den gikk rett til hjertet på meg, og rørte meg dypt. Som f.eks da Christopher mistet kjæledyret sitt - en rotte - ned i skinnegangen, og hopper ned for å få tak i den, og ikke skjønner hvorfor alle skriker til ham og kaver med å få ham opp, inntil han ser toget som kommer i full fart mot ham ... Han skulle jo bare redde rotta si fra den sikre død. Det er bare å gi seg over for denne boka! </review>

	<review>Exceeds the hype: We first listened to The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time on BBC Book at Bedtime. Riveted, we couldn't afford to miss an episode. We laughed, we were moved, and we loved it. I wondered if it would be as satisfying to read the book as it had been to listen to it. Finally, I bought the book, and I am happy to say that, yes, it is even more satisfying to read the book, as I enjoyed the small bits that had been pared from the radio script.Although the content of this book is anything but simple, the writing looks simple. This keeps with the main character Christopher's need to reduce the overwhelming information input of the world into manageable form. He needs to categorise people and things into black and white, good and bad, etc, and he struggles with that which will not 'fit'. While I felt great sympathy for Christopher, I frequently ended up rolling in great belly laughs! This is a gift of Mark Haddon's writing.Super original. Hilarious. Heart-tugging. This is an amazing book. If you have not read it yet, you're really missing something.</review>

	<review>This story line ran parrellel with its purpose-which was "a day in the life" of a person with autism.  Through the storyline, the reader can see specific examples of how the mind of an autistic person works. This was a very thought provoking read for facts and examples of autisim, but the novel also has an interesting storyline and some shocking surprises that make the ending worthwhile. Strong language included.</review>

	<review>A monologue with many digressions into mathematical musings, from the point of view of an autistic teenager. The story is rather simple: Christopher finds his neighbor's dog dead in her yard. He determines to find out who did it. His investigations lead him to discover not only who killed the dog (halfway through the book) but to uncover a hidden family secret that throws his orderly life into chaos and unsettles his already dysfunctional family. The most poignant aspect of it all is that he relates the most emotionally wrenching incidents with no hint of emotion at all, or even understanding. For that contrast alone I found it interesting. But the ending was highly unsatisfying and rather unrealistic.from the Dog Ear Diary </review>

	<review>The Boston Globe called this book, "gloriously eccentric..." which is an inaccurate way to represent this story by Mark Haddon.  If anything, Haddon enters the world of autism and demystifies it, making it less eccentric.  We see the world through the eyes of fifteen year-old Christopher Boone, who abhors the color yellow, but calms himself by solving complicated math problems in his head.  The reader learns to re-calibrate his or her own emotional responses a la Christopher, for whom things hurt according to their logical content or lack thereof.This book has many strengths, and Christopher's father is perhaps one of the best examples of a sympathetic but highly flawed character.  While Christopher is undoubtedly the book's protagonist, the non-autistic reader will more likely empathize with Christopher's father, who is capable of both great love and great destruction.Aside from Christopher's discussions with his therapist Siobhan, the book wisely veers away from preachy explanations about autism.  Even the therapy sessions are more about interpersonal connection than outlining the intricacies of autism, and it is this that helps the reader to connect to Christopher in something other than sympathy.  We engage with Christopher's world, not the world of autism...and this is right as autism spectrum disorders defy generalizations or easy categories.The end result, if anything, is that the eccentricity of general humanity is exposed.  We become conscious of our everyday lack of logic.  The novel  is just as much about the human condition as the autistic condition. </review>

	<review>This is an unusual but compelling story told through the viewpoint of the protagonist, an autistic teenager.  It is presented as a book that he has written and we get good idea of what goes on inside the head of a person with this condition.  He is extremely smart, especially in math and puzzles but finds it difficult to function-even to think-when his system is overloaded with too much stimuli.  The basic idea is that he has decided to try to detect who killed the neighbor's dog with a pitchfork in the middle of the night.  He finds out more than he wants to which leads to a somewhat frightening adventure.  This is a great story well told-no wonder it was so popular.  This is a novel that would appeal to young adults as well as older readers.  It also gives the reader some insight into the difficulties that face people with autism and the people who love them. </review>

	<review>Christopher is fifteen years old. He lives in Swindon, England, with his father. He knows all the prime numbers up to 7,057. He can name all the countries in the world, and their capital cities. He hates the colours yellow and brown. He loves animals and keeps a pet rat, Toby. Soon he's going to be sitting his Maths A-level.But Christopher has behavioural problems: he does not like being touched; he smashes things and screams when he gets angry or confused; he never smiles; and he refuses to eat food if it is touching another sort of food. Christopher is autistic.One night, Christopher discovers his neighbour's poodle, Wellington, lying dead in the garden. Christopher decides to become a detective and find the killer. This book is his story. Because he cannot comprehend figures of speech or use sarcasm or even imagine things which did not happen, Christopher writes this book as a series of faithfully recorded conversations and observations. A detailed diary of this thoughts and actions.Haddon's debut novel is a disturbing book. Although it is funny in parts it is awfully sad in others. The author succeeds in exposing to the reader the world of an autistic child (Haddon worked with autistics) by avoiding the pitfalls of excessive sentimentalism or exploitation of a sensitive subject. It is easy to fall in love with Christopher, who needs to cope not only with his disability but also with a dysfunctional family that is breaking apart around him.I can only hope that when the movie version of this book is made, it will not be a soppy schmaltz like "Rain Man". </review>

	<review>Not typically the sort of book I read, but my wife picked it up and I became interested.  An autistic boy (how old is he?) plays sleuth when he discovers a dead dog on his neighbour's front lawn.  The story becomes something less interesting (to me) halfway through, but the narrative voice of the boy kept me hooked.  I've no real-life experience with autism, but the author appears to have captured it convincingly.  Very interesting digressions, inserted in a 'Cryptonomicon' sort of way. </review>

	<review>I originally decided to read this book because I thought it sounded intriguing. After the first couple of pages I couldn't put it down. The writing is top notch; you feel as if this child is actually writing this book. The book is about so much more than just discovering who killed his neighbors dog, in fact the book continues long after he knows the truth, or what he is told to be the truth. Be prepared to experience a gamut of emotions, and be left wanting more when you finish the final page. </review>

	<review>In a word, Boring.It's a short novel written from the perspective of an autistic boy, and has to do with him solving the murder of a dog. But not really. It's really a contemplation of love and family from the point of view of someone who can not possibly contemplate these things. People are objects to the main character. For emotional content the reader looks to the people that care for him; his parents, teacher. This book feels like a gimmick to me. Like it relies on you being shocked by the protagonist's alternative way of thinking in order to hide it's lack of interesting plot or character development or anything that usually makes stories worth reading. Maybe it's because I read a lot of science fiction and I am used to first person narratives showing the world from a different perspective. Nothing special here for me. In the end it did a good job of doing what it does, I was just hoping for more emotional impact. Or anything. </review>

	<review>Shurie GeisEDCI 41207-10-08	Haddon, Mark. (2003). the curious incident of the dog in the night-time. New York: Doubleday.Grade Levels: 8-9Category: Problem NovelRead-Alouds: pp. 1-10 (dog is killed, goes to jail), 74-83 (find out about mom’s affair, fight with dad) 216-221 (gets dog from dad, gets “A” on tests)Summary: Christopher, 13, is autistic, and one night he finds the neighbor’s dog dead in her backyard. The dog’s owner comes out to find him with the dog and assumes that he killed it, so she calls the police. Christopher is arrested for killing the dog and hitting a police officer. This inspires him to investigate the murder of the dog. In doing so, he finds out that his mother (whom his father has said was dead) actually left them and is living in London, and that his father is the one that killed the dog. Christopher runs away from home and travels to London by himself to find his mother. His father follows him and wants him to come back and live with him. In the end, Christopher and his mother go to live in the same town as his father, and his father tries to fix their relationship.Themes: The book is written by him in first person, so you get to an inside look at how Christopher’s brain works and why this makes sense to him. You get to see his struggles and follow him through many trials. In the end, Christopher has learned to be more independent and ways to overcome his autism. There aren’t many other themes in the book, except marriage and divorce (by examining Christopher’s parents). Discussion Questions: Do you feel that Christopher’s father was wrong in lying to him about his mother, or did he do what he felt he had to for Christopher? Explain.What is going on in Christopher’s mind when he “goes out of it” for a few hours? How do you know how long he was “out” for? Give examples from the text.What do you make of the relationship between Mrs. Shear’s and Christopher’s father? What about between Mr. Shear’s and Christopher’s mother?Reader Response: This novel was very interesting to read. I learned a lot of autism that I didn’t know before. As a reader, I really connected to Christopher, even though the text was sometimes hard to follow. It was really interesting that the novel was written as if by Christopher as a class project, so it talked a lot about random things that he would think about to take his mind off of other things around him. I feel that this would be a valuable text to have in the classroom because it would give students who have little experience with autism an insider’s perspective on it.</review>

	<review>The Take Away:  This was a really good view of how an autistic boy views the world.  He figures out the wiggle room in his father's instructions (what kid doesn't?) loves math and uses primary numbers to label the chapters instead of cardinals.  While investigating the death of the neighbor's dog, he uncovers a truth kept from him by his father.  What he does after uncovering the truth took a tremendous amount of courage - especially for a boy who doesn't like change, new things or strange people.The book does an excellent job of showing how someone who is autistic views and acts in our world. </review>

	<review>Talk about a breath of fresh air in the world of literature. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time by Mark Haddon is an incredibly engrossing story told through the eyes of a 15 year old boy with Asperger’s Syndrome, a type of autism.This book is a murder mystery. Christopher Boone finds his neighbors dog stabbed through the body with a garden fork. He then begins an investigation to find out who the murderer is. As he looks for the murderer, he writes a book, a sort of journal, detailing his search, his findings, his observations and feelings. The more complicated the investigation gets, the more Christopher has to pull himself out of his comfort zone and be brave. He is clever and very observant of all details. There is lots of drama with his family and neighbors. A lot of inadvertant jokes, made on his behalf and some made by him, and plenty of sentimentallity. Haddon’s ability to communicate to the rest of the world through a dissociated mind is an incredible take on the world of literature.More at: http://thenovelworld.com </review>

	<review>This well-written novel is an account of a series of traumatic events that befall a young autistic man, told from the point of view of the man himself.  The author explores both what it means to be human within the human self and what it means to be human among other humans.  The excursions into the mathematical realm are intelligent and apt.  It is an easy and enjoyable read, and is the first book I've read in a single sitting in a long, long time. </review>

	<review>This book gives the reader a unique perspective with narration by a 15-year-old boy with Asperger's syndrome.  We see a small slice of Christopher's life and his daily struggles to keep up in a world he does not always understands (puns, jokes, and facial expressions are just a few of the things he cannot comprehend well) as he searches for the killer of his neighbor's dog, a search which in turn reveals a number of secrets.  Since we are supposed to believe the book is being written by Christopher as the events unfold, it is an interesting twist on the act of writing, as the novel lays open the aspects of writing and editing that go into making a good work of fiction (i.e., Christopher's teacher/aide continually tells him what to leave in or out of the book).  The idea is fresh, and the writing flow makes it a quick read, but I think the portrait of Christopher is not exactly correct.  Since Asperger's syndrome is on the higher functioning end of the autism spectrum, he would probably have less of the troubles described in the book, but since my knowledge of this area is not much, I cannot really comment much on this. </review>

	<review>"A sus quince años, Christhoper Boone, conoce las capitales de todos los países del mundo, puede explicar la teoría de la relatividad y recitar los números primos hasta el 7.507 pero le cuesta relacionarse con otros seres humanos. Le gustan las listas, los esquemas y la verdad, pero odia el amarillo, el marrón y el contacto físico. Si bien nunca ha ido solo más allá de la tienda de la esquina, la noche que el perro de la vecina aparece atravesado por un horcón, Christopher decide iniciar la búsqueda del culpable."  (edit. promo.)Un libro del que oyes tantas recomendaciones que al final te hacen sospechar si será bueno. Al final, su inclusión en las tertulias literarias me ha servido de pretexto para su lectura.No está mal, pero sin más. Supongo que obras como Rain Man o Una mente maravillosa, han creado el abono para que germine el mito del autista superdotado y esta novela, a mi entender, no hace más que subirse a ese carro. Te describe el mundo desde la primera persona del chaval y al final consigue hacerte ver las cosas desde su punto de vista (en lo cual estriba el verdadero mérito de la obra) Pero en las mismas tertulias comentaron que se trata la enfermedad desde un punto de vista muy amable, la única participación que se le exige al lector es que observe al chaval en sus evoluciones con una cierta perplejidad y punto. Bueno, no sé si me explico muy bien. </review>

	<review>A very interesting book. I took it up because of the reviews on Librarything. :) It tells the story of an autistic child lost in a world filled with people whom he does not understand and who do not understand him.I liked the viewpoint of the book, and I think that reading this book would help people understand autistic people. Although, at times. it seemed that the main character's difference was too underlined, and at times the writer seemed not to think from his point of view.All in all, a very refreshing, different kind of book. </review>

	<review>This book was recommended to me by quite a few folks, but I'm having a hard time figuring out why--perhaps simply because I'm an English teacher, and this book is unique.  Regardless, as you may already have guessed, I wasn't impressed.  I can appreciate what Haddon was trying to do, as well as the technical difficulty of trying to write a believable book from the perspective of a teenager with Aspergers' syndrome.  HOWEVER, at some point, it has to be recognized that perhaps there's a reason there's not an abundance of books narrated in such a way. It comes across as believable (caveat--I am not very familiar with teens with [learning] disabilities of any kind)--but not all that interesting.  It gained my interest briefly about a third of the way in, but that portion of the story was resolved quickly and simply moved on from.If you want to see a full-blown writing experiment or a very simple story made complicated, pick this up.  Otherwise, I felt the writing was often stilted and the book, overall, just not all that interesting or meaningful.  I hate to ask what the point is, but when the entertainment is lacking and nothing larger seems to make it worthwhile, I have to.  I wouldn't recommend this, to anyone really, unless perhaps I needed to convince them of the unsuitability of a possible narrator As a narrator.... </review>

	<review>I don't get the hype.  I do get that this is a unique narrative becasue it takes a look at how an autistic mind sees and processes life, so for that, I can appreciate this book.  That is really all this book has to offer, though - its just not that entertaining, and I had to put it down a lot to be able to finish it.  Not sorry I read it at all, but for me, it doesn't merit all the hoopla and "best of" lists. </review>

	<review>A heartbreaking story of an autistic boy caught in a sad domestic squabble between his parents.  Written in first person from Christopher’s point of view the novel explores the everyday wonders and terrors of his life.  A  murdered dog turns his life upside down, eventually leading to his making a solo journey to London, and a heroic adventure for the reader.  I was in tears at the ending, but the book does leave a lot of room for hope as well. </review>

	<review>June 2007 selection Some of us found the main character's voice and actions disturbing, but others were able to see humor in the matter-of-fact way he saw things because of his autism. This was a thought-provoking book and the group found it interesting, even if we couldn't agree on why. The young boy, in whose voice the story is told, is a very engaging character and the story moves quickly. This book is unlikely to be like anything you have ever read.Pros: unique perspective of the protagonist, interesting plot twist Cons: subject matter can be depressing, upsetting to some Publisher's page for book: http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/di... </review>

	<review>This book is "written" by an autistic boy of 15 years old. Although he is attending a special school and has many Behavioural Problems (he lists a number of them), he is very good at maths, and is preparing for his A Level exam. He lives alone with his father, his mother died two years ago. The title of the book refers to a neighbour's dog that is killed with a garden fork, and Christopher, the boy, is the first to find the dead dog and is initially accused of killing it. He then decides to do some detective work to find out who did kill the dog. His father is not keen, and forbids him to talk to or bother anyone about the dog. For good reason, because when Christopher does some research anyway, he finds out more than he expected. The book is written totally in Christopher's style, meaning that the text is very literal ("I read a book until 7.46 and then I ..."). It is also quite childish and contains some maths that not everyone will appreciate (but it's easily skipped). An easy read, and it did teach me a few things about autism, although I don't think a real autist could have written this on his own. </review>

	<review>I loved this book. Not only is it one of the few - if not only - books I've read that actually conveys life through the eyes of a person with autism, it tells a wonderfully crafted story.My favorite thing about this book is that the story you think you're reading is not the real story. </review>

	<review>well, this book turned out to be a lot different than what i expected. initially, i was vaguely amused by the "musings" of christopher...i enjoyed his spin on the world, and thought how orderly and clean his life seemed, until it all unraveled. i think mostly i was annoyed with his parents, whose actions in any other child's life might not have been so detrimental, but turned christopher's world upside down. and yet, they were human, too, and are entitled to some leeway simply for living with him. then again, perhaps they were obligated to be a bit better than the average parents. i finished it quickly, and felt sort of deflated when it was over. i didn't dislike it, rather enjoyed it but could only recommend with reservation. </review>

	<review>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a unique glimpse into the mind of an autistic child. His single-minded attempt to 'detect' who killed his neighbour's beloved dog is both logical and inspiring. Some parts of the story are very sad, others are amusing, and little pictures throughout the book give a small insight into how this boys mind works. This is one book that ought to be on everyone's reading list. </review>

	<review>I avoided this book for a long time. Not because of the popularity or how everyone told me to read it. Because my brother, who is 11, has Asperger's Syndrome, which is in the autism spectrum, and acts a lot like Christopher Boone.He refused to eat yellow food as a child. He eats it now, if it's french fries with heaps of ketchup. He thinks in numbers and science, but hates to read. Fortunately, he enjoys hugs. But reading this book really brought a lot of emotions out of me because it was seriously like reading the inner thoughts of my younger brother.To bring this away from me, it's a fantastic book. The tangents the narrator goes on show exactly how some autistic children think and act. The plot is serious enough to make a depressing movie, but to see it from Christopher's point-of-view almost makes it easier while at the same time pulling the heartstrings even more.I'd  definitely recommend this book to anyone. </review>

	<review>I absolutely loved this book. It was such a refreshing, original novel, with such an incredible premise and a beautiful rendering. It takes us into an entirely different point of view, allowing us to see the world - a very visual and particular world, - through Christopher's eyes. We are witness to Christopher's unique understanding of people, of what surrounds him, of what is important and what is not to him. It's a poigant, touching story that I will remember for a long time. A beautiful book. I highly recommend it. </review>

	<review>Be careful! The emotional impact of this story sneaks up on you. Told from the point of view of 15-year-old, autistic Christopher Boone, Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time leads you to believe that it is going to be a mystery when Christopher decides to investigate the murder of his neighbor's dog, Wellington, who he finds with a pitchfork through his side. What happens beyond this plot is an amazing study into the needs and struggles of those who suffer from "special needs" and their families.I want to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this book, but the surprise wasn't necessarily pleasant. Haddon has created an amazing book that has an unbelievable emotional pull that will leave you both shocked and sympathetic for the characters. It is a fast read, but very well crafted. </review>

	<review>I found this a very compelling read, in no small part because of the inner world of the narrator, who has Asperger's Syndrome. However, because of that, he doesn't really develop at all - which at the end left me feeling like, for him, the whole book was just a bunch of stuff that happened. </review>

	<review>This book was so clever!  Having known a few people with this type of autism, I thought the main character was spot on.  All of the awkwardness that comes with interactions with people who don't really know what they're dealing with was there and very real.  It was a light, fun read, that also deals with the struggles of life in a way that was unique and endearing. </review>

	<review>Fifteen year-old Christopher loves maths, hates people and doesn't understand jokes. So when his neighbour's dog is found dead with a pitch fork stuck through his body, finding out the mystery killer isn't going to be easy for Christopher.I bought this book just before I got on a plane for an overseas trip for a month. I was expecting it to last me the whole time, but by the time I had got off the plane, I only had a few pages left - and I thought I'd been 'preserving' it. Mark Haddon creates such a realistic atmosphere that I can't help but laugh at some events. There were also twists and pictures which made it more engaging. </review>

	<review>This book was a short and easy read. It was very well written with little pictures and math puzzles thrown in. The description of the book gives off a depressed, sad vibe, but I assure you that its far from it. The story is a very entertaining and humorous even though Christopher states early in the book that he doesn’t understand jokes. Mark Haddon portrays an autistic teenager really well, the writing is very simple. As I read the book Christopher’s character jumped out of the pages, I felt myself sympathizing with him. This is a wonderful book with many laughs and heartbreaks. </review>

	<review>I've never read anything like this; it is a truly unique little book. The story is told as a first person account of autistic teenager, Christopher. His neighbor's dog is killed with a pitchfork, and since he enjoys puzzles so much, he decides to solve the mystery of whodunnit. What he doesn't anticipate is that the evidence will lead him to much larger secrets, bringing to light many new emotions that are nearly impossible for him to cope with. The innovative perspective used in the novel allows the author to illustrate the many nuances of autism, from Christopher's love of logic, to his dislike of physical contact, to his various phobias. The narrative is fascinating and believable, and the reader comes to understand many of the challenges autistic individuals must face regularly. The writing is simple but still manages to be eloquent, a testament to the talent of the author. This novel is short and easy to read, but the story will stick with me for a long time. </review>

	<review>When the protagonist, Christopher Boone,finds a neighbor's dog stabbed with a garden fork, he sits to hold the loveable creature and wonders how anyone could do such a terrible thing.  His humanity, therefore, surfaces early in the story and continues to pull the reader along through a fascinating mystery of many deceptions.  Though the author never names the boy's handicapping condition, most would recognize  his extraordinary math/science ability and his social/emotional challenges as Asperger's syndrome or perhaps a savant syndrome similar to the condition of "The Rainman" in the academy award winning performance by Dustin Hoffman.  The young man's tenacity in pursuing the dog's murderer as well as his Math A Level exams is both admirable and oddly frustrating.  The strength of the story is in the well drawn characterizations of the boy, his parents, and even the neighbors and school personnel.  A weakness may be the unusual and difficult math problems worked into the story which many would not comprehend!   In the classroom discussion might involve the nature of autism, Asperger's syndrome, and savants as well as family stress when dealing with challenged children.  Also, the theme of honesty is a pervasive issue as is the difficulty of re-gaining trust when significant lies have been told. </review>

	<review>A very soothing book, not for its content, but for its style, although it has a happy ending.  The point of view (autistic first person) buffers the reader against spots of potential tear-jerkiness.  A few things happen that, from one's own point of view, are horrific or sad; but the reader can identify so well with the diarist, and he reports them so matter-of-factly or with such satisfaction in coping, that one's net feeling about them is hope and reassurance.Although I m'self am rather at the opposite end of the spectrum from autistic, I was able to relate to this character with what felt like a great deal of understanding.  Reading his words, I could imagine myself his friend; it became a game to put down the book periodically and imagine a conversation with him.On the other hand, the book was hard to put down at all - I stayed up way too late finishing it!The book lends itself to further pondering and discussion, beyond just being a good read to while away an evening.  One of my friends, a teacher and part-time actress, works with autistic children and I have seen her portray an autistic young woman on stage in a realistic and highly sympathetic characterization.  Also, one of my cousins works with special-needs children.  I'm looking forward to finding out their opinions of this book.</review>

	<review>While Christopher’s quirks are interesting, the best part of the book is the affect that he has on the people around him, namely his parents. His relationship with his father is beautiful and heartbreaking and only becomes more so as the story continues and the truth is revealed about Wellington’s death. The juxtaposition between the ways in which Christopher’s parents deal with the reality of having an autistic son is fascinating. His father shows tremendous patience in dealing with his son’s condition only to lose his wife and eventually his son. Christopher’s mother finds that she is unable to cope and leaves, losing touch completely with her family.... http://yodamarie.blogspot.com/2008/04... </review>

	<review>I know that "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time" isn't a completely accurate depiction of living with Asperger's, and I know that the plot does tend to drift over the course of the book.  Despite its flaws, I love it.  The book is fun, but more importantly, it's different.  So much current fiction coming onto the market reads as if the authors are all using the same computer program to write their books for them, but this work is a refreshing change.  You feel as if you spend your time in this book living within the boy's mind, and it is definitely an interesting place to be. </review>

	<review>This is a very easy-to-read book that goes by fast.  The protagonist, Christopher, is 15 years old and autistic, so the book is written in a staccato way.  Christopher has quirks and genius qualities and sometimes goes on for pages about complicated math problems.  There is some disturbing content, but not enough to make me dislike the book at all.  5 stars. </review>

He is brilliant at memorizing numbers and facts, but he is unable to comprehend human emotions. He can not tolerate touvh, but he gravitates towards dogs. When trying to solve the mystery of the dead dog, we see the emotional reactions of those around him. We care deeply about Christopher even though he cannot feel emotions, especially when we learn of his parents' marriage unravelling. This would be excellent as an example of creative writing from a special needs point of view. This should appeal to both male and female young adults, and the various small illustrations add to its diversion. It won the Whitbread Award in 2003.</review>

	<review>I wasn't really sure what to expect when reading this novel. All I knew was that it was written from the perspective of an autistic boy. It intrigued me. As it turns out, I'm very glad I bought it.It starts out as a murder mystery: a neighbour's dog had been killed. This leads to the main character setting out to find the culprit. It turns into the boy finding out a lot of information about people in his life. This new information causes him to get confused about everything, which leads to more trouble.I really enjoyed reading this. I'm glad the author wrote it this way - with the point of view that of an autistic boy. It made the novel such a pleasure to read, getting an inside view of what someone with autism may think. </review>

	<review>It's very easy to dismiss this book by its title, by its subject matter, or by its blurb on the back cover; but if you were to dismiss it, you'd be missing out on an excellent read.Haddon introduces us gently to his narrator, autistic fifteen-year-old Christopher, patiently building the character alternately through his involvement with the people he knows (his teacher Siobhan and his father, mostly) and through the savant skills he has in advanced mathematics and physics.The central mystery of the novel turns out to be only slightly more than a MacGuffin, but there are revelations a-plenty in a book that feels like it's somewhere between a mystery novel and a coming-of-age story, and manages to utilize the best features of both.Chris turns out to be an extremely likable character, particularly since he's surrounded by a world that is so radically unlikable, and it is how he attempts to remain calm in the face of discomfort he can do nothing about reveals his character more clearly than words.  To this end, it's amazing the kind of command Haddon exercises over the feelings of his readers, and by the end, though the novel features an ending far from the happy Hollywood ideal, there's a great amount of hope, patiently built from the ground up.It's relatively short, reads very quickly, and is impressive in both its economy of language and emotional impact.  Highly recommended.</review>

	<review>This was an interesting book to read. Rarely is a child with autism the main character, let alone the narrator. It moved along fairly quickly and you got a feel for what it would be like to be autistic or have asperger's. I didn't like that they gave away who killed the dog so early in the book, but that wasn't really the focus anyways. </review>

	<review>I enjoyed reading this book. Written from the perspective of a fifteen year-old boy with "special needs," this book explores the reality of living and coping with Asperger's Syndrome while entertaining the reader with a mystery plot and a dysfunctional family storyline. After reading this book, one cannot help but understand the struggles children growing up with Aspergers face each day. My heart went out to the main character, Christopher,  as he faced each new obstacle. Many of the obstacles he faces I  for granted (like eating yellow food). I had a 15 year-old student who had Asperger's and loved dogs, who sometimes made "rude" comments about the intelligence of others and who had to make each essay perfect even if it took all night. I wish I had read this book before having him in my class. I might have been more understanding. </review>

	<review>I really enjoyed this book and found it so engaging I read it twice. Haddon's portrayal of Christopher as he learns to live with his autism is brilliant and heart-rending. You admire this young man's intelligence and clerverness, yet pity him for how his autism leaves him struggling desperately to cope in various social situations. This would be a fine book to recommend to high school math teachers to include in their curriculum for the math and logic problems. It would also provide insight  for the same students into the struggles faced by their fellow students with autism. </review>

	<review>15 year old Christopher, who has an autistic spectrum disorder, investigates who murdered his neighbour's dog. In the process he unearths some family secrets.I read this immediately after Elizabeth Moon's Speed of Dark, which is about an autistic adult in the near future. This one was very enjoyable, but quite different and, in my opinion, not as good. It is primarily about human relationships, rather than ethical questions and the nature of identity. While it was well done, it didn't grab me to the same extent as Moon's book. It reads as a children's book, which is not a complaint but an observation on the first person narrator's voice and style of self-presentation. There are quirks in Christopher's comprehension of the world that result from his autism, but his lack of life skills and ability to interpret others' behaviour make him resemble a much younger child more than anything else, albeit one with precocious logical abilities. It's difficult to pin down what I mean by the narratorial style marking this as a children's book. I suppose it is partly that Christopher explains the familiar with naive, fresh perspective and seems always to have a conscious expectation of an audience. Most of the humour - and the pathos - comes from dramatic irony, since we understand the events he describes and their significance more fully than he does. The mathematical and logic problem interludes are interesting as factoids in their own right, but what Christopher finds in them that others do not (to the same extent) is not expressed, and I never really had the sense of walking in the character's shoes that Elizabeth Moon manages so well. </review>

	<review>Amazingly written! I haven't read anything like it. It makes you think about how we take even the simplest things for granted and makes you wonder what it would be like if you weren't "normal". I found Christopher's courage and determination amazing. The quirky bits of humor lighten the story while allowing you inside of Christopher's world. I did find the informational chapters a bit hard to get through, but overall this was an excellent book. </review>

	<review>I literally could not put this book down.  Really.  I carried it with me everywhere so I could always open it up and read a few more sentences in between whatever I was doing.  I'm pretty sure I finished it in a day, two at most.Curious Incident really gave me an insight into the lives of people with autism.  (Though I did wonder about the author's background in that field.  Has he observed autistic people or is he completely making this up?)  While you may feel that you have nothing in common with a teenaged, British, autistic boy, you may find that you and Christopher are more alike than you might think.  I certainly did. </review>

	<review>This is a lovely, warm, funny and sad story of an autistic boy and his struggles with the everyday tasks most of us take for granted.  It also shows the difficulty of bringing up an autistic child and the colossal pressure that exerts on his parents and their relationship.  Should be read by anyone seeking to understand the condition and how it affects the lives of those who have it and those around them. </review>

	<review>Of course I didn't think I would be interested.  It didn't seem like the kind of book I usually like.  A friend convinced me to read it and I was gobsmacked.  This is a fresh, compelling read, spare and right on target.  Christopher, the autistic mathematical prodigy, gives us a narration unlike others.  More than naive, more than merely logical, but flatly quirky and Haddon uses this tone to bring a dark humor to bear.  Perhaps I loved this more because I am an actuary, prone to organizing things by color (candy at work and I know they bait me) and sometimes the voice of reason and logic speaks too loudly in my world. </review>

	<review>Christopher Boone is 15 years old, a mathematical genius, and autistic. He can’t tolerate the colours yellow and brown. He groans to calm himself down and does maths puzzles to relax.  He doesn’t understand emotions, cannot tolerate being touched and is unable to take too much new information in at a time.His precisely planned world goes into turmoil when he discovers Wellington, the neighbour’s poodle, dead with a garden fork through him. The neighbour in question catches him cradling the dog and had him arrested.While in the slammer, Christopher resolved to discover who killed Wellington. His father and neighbours objected to this, but he gets encouragement from Siobhan, a social worker at his school, to write a book about his investigations.What began as a murder mystery gradually turned into something bigger and more personal than he could imagine. A revelation sent him running off to London, which is nothing to most 15-year olds, but was terrifying for someone who can mentally cave in from information overload.If it were any other teenager, this book would have been an angst fest. From an autistic savant’s perspective, you’ll be drawn to look at the world through his eyes.Despite the fact that Christopher keeps insisting that this is not a going to be a funny book, his literal observations are often side-splitting. I arrived at this book years late, but it is still worth it. Now here’s an award winner I heartily approve of.(2006) </review>

	<review>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon is a very fun, unique book to read- especially if you are interested in mathematics and logic. Christopher is 15, has a form of autism, loves math, and hates the colors yellow and brown. He sees the world through logic and those around him can only reach him through logic. One night he discovers his neighbor’s dog has been murdered and sets out to find the killer. This leads him not only to the perpetrator but also to a personal adventure as well.I really admire this book. Haddon made Christopher a completely convincing character, and I would love there to be a sequel. </review>

	<review>Christopher Boone is autistic. He is wonderful at math, but cannot abide novels because metaphors are lies. He understands science and wants everything according to an orderly plan. He doesn’t understand people’s facial expressions and hates to be touched. Most of all he dislikes new places and strangers because there is too much to take in. But when Christopher finds the neighbor’s dog Wellington murdered, he faces his fears to investigate the death, and records his thoughts and observations in this book. The book was a very good record of what goes on in the head of someone interested only in logic and science and dismissive of emotion – so the author definitely accomplished what he set out to do. And for this very reason I have problems with the book (much in the same way as with Catcher in the Rye). Christopher's reactions are difficult for me to empathize with: the groaning, the matter-of-fact tone, and the near uncontrollable disproportionate violence. His complete discounting of emotion evokes pity, but also fear of what a person so devoid of empathy might do. And his contempt of the parts of humanity I hold most dear doesn't serve to endear him to me - quite the contrary. His favorite dream of everyone who looks at people’s faces dying out and leaving only people like himself is one of the most frightening things I’ve ever read.ETA: Since posting this review, several people have told me that my response is discriminatory and hate aimed at people with autism. I disagree - Christopher's worldview is largely the opposite of mine, and I find him difficult to understand. However, what I find disturbing about the book (and the character) is the repeated expression of a desire that everyone NOT like him be eradicated from the world - a category that quite obviously includes me. Of course, everyone has such daydreams - particularly as a child. But Curious Incident seemed to hammer away at this idea, which disturbs me. That said, I don't think such a fantasy is shared by all people with autism (beyond the degree that everyone has it), nor do I think they all behave in just this manner. But if this is an accurate portrayal, I do think that I am ill-equipped (and too emotional) to be able to deal well with a person like Christopher, either for his benefit or for mine. But I wish to stress that this does not mean that I hate any actual person with similar characteristics. </review>

C'est absolument incroyable la façon dont l'auteur nous emmène dans l'esprit de ce jeune garçon et nous fait comprendre ce qui est à priori complètement incompréhensible pour ceux qui ne cotoient pas des autistes. Ca m'a vraiment fort troublé et c'est assurément le genre de lecture qui modifie sensiblement le vision du monde qui nous entourre. </review>

	<review>Christopher John Francis Boone knows all the countries of the world and their capitals and every prime number up to 7057. He relates well to animals but has no understanding of human emotions. He cannot stand to be touched. And he detests the colour yellow.Although gifted with a superbly logical brain, fifteen-year-old Christopher is autistic and everyday interactions and admonishments have little meaning for him. He lives on patterns, rules, and a diagram kept in his pocket. Then one day, a neighbour's dog, Wellington, is killed and his carefully constructed universe is threatened. Christopher sets out to solve the murder in the style of his favourite (logical) detective, Sherlock Holmes. What follows makes for a novel that is deeply funny, poignant, and fascinating in its portrayal of a person whose curse and blessing are a mind that perceives the world entirely literally.</review>

	<review>WOAH this book is really good! It's about an autistic kid who plays detective to find out who killed his neighbor's dog, Wellington. He does this because he cares about dogs and because they think he did it. but while he is playing Sherlock Holmes, he uncovers a bigger mystery about his family that he has to solve. It's a really nice book and the style of writting is unique because it's from the point of view from an autistic kid... it's a really good book even though this kid must be like... super high-functioning... anyway. read it it's good. </review>

	<review>A character so devoid of emotion yet you end up competely emotionally attached to him.  So infuriating and loveable within sentences of each other.  No wonder his parents were screwed up!  I loved and hated them as much as I loved and hated him - but all with that familial affection that makes everything OK (if you know what I mean).  It was just such a simple, short, neat story that was so jammed full of amazing personal connections both between characters and between the reader and the characters that I found it unputdownable.  I know this book has recieved a lot of praise and I can definately understand why.  Dont go expecting some sort of change-your-life book though, as I said, its beautiful in its simplicity.  Oh, not to mention an amazing learning into Aspergers/Autism. </review>

	<review>Written from an autistic child's point of view, you are lead though a family breakdown by way of the mystery of how a dog died. The author achieved my gaining an understanding of what it may be like to be autistic, giving me understanding of how an autistic person thinks. Rain man, even the movie with Dustin Hoffman at his character acting best, really just gave a small insight, more external really, this novel, with its deceptively simple language, left me feeling that I understood. It is also an enjoyable read. Very clever. </review>

	<review>This is one of those books that is way outside of my usual genre of reading. I was attracted to the book by: (a) the allusion to Sherlock Holmes in the title (I am a fan of Sherlock Holmes mysteries [although not mysteries in general]), (b) the look at autism that is the subject matter of the book (some of our best friends have an autistic child), and (c) the number of diagrams, charts, and other unusual non-standard material that I saw as I flipped through the pages. Following the novel (?) use of graphics and other things to add to the story in Angels  Demons and The Da Vinci Code, Haddon's use of additional material to supplement the text intrigued me. So, I decided to venture outside my comfort zone and read the book. I'm glad I did. First, it is a very quick read. More importantly, it is a very well-told story that allows a reader a glimpse into the thought process of an autistic teenager. For anyone curious about autism, I recommend the book highly. For those who are only interested in a murder mystery, this book will not be satisfying (the mystery is resolved fairly early in the story, but it, in turn, leads to further complications for the autistic narrator). Finally, for parents of autistic children, this book may hit a little too close to home; that said, I would love to know how realistic the author's portrayal of an autistic teenager really is. </review>

	<review>I was really looking forward to reading this book.  I had heard it mentioned on several individual "best books" lists and had heard a good deal about it.  Although I found the book to be a fun, interesting, and even touching read at times, I was somewhat let down.  The story and the writing is unique as it is written from Christopher's point of view, but I felt that too much of the book relied on this novelty.  At times I felt as the author was stretching to add meaning to the story and I was pushing myself to continue, but eventually I became involved in the plot.  The point of view of the book allows the reader to feel a closeness to the character and the story takes some surprising turns that make this a compelling read overall, but not as exceptional as the hype would lead one to believe. </review>

	<review>This story is a wonderful mix of hilarity and heartache. From the first paragraph, I was enamored with Christopher and his story. The subject of Asperger's Syndrome was fairly unfamiliar to me before picking this book up, as I think it has been to the majority of the US until fairly recently, and using a child's voice to explain what the disease is and how it works was a very clever and useful way of enlightening the public. The way Christopher sees the world is fascinating, often humorous, and sometimes very heartbreaking. I was routing for him the entire time and often found myself mentally talking him through certain situations (navigating the British Rail system, learning to communicate with others, understanding what happened to his mother). By the end of the book, I felt as though Christopher was a real boy, at least in my own head, and I wanted to protect him from the world. This book was absolutely lovely and I don't see any reason why everyone shouldn't read it. </review>

	<review>Reading this book again changes my perspective a fair bit. To be honest with my review reading fans, here's my previous review to show you what I previously thought the last time I read it:"Absolute rubbish. Of course Asperger's children are capable of emotion. Trouble is they have problems expressing it. And what was up with Christopher not being able to understand jokes/metaphors on any level? Yes, Asperger's kids tend to take things literally sometimes, but not all the time, and it's more likely that Christopher could have been able to ask for help with understanding them, instead of turning to these clueless adults who have no sensitivity. No wonder Christopher seems like he doesn't have a soul, Mark Haddon treats him like he doesn't have one.As a young person with Asperger's, I've read a lot about the condition, and this book was as offensive to me as a copy of The Satanic Verses would be to a member of the Taliban. Do avoid giving this book to parents who want to find out more about Asperger's, as it is very misleading."However; reading this book again has made me notice a few things about myself that I didn't recognise the first time I read it:1: The "Not Recognising Faces" thing. As an Asperger's person it's true that we have trouble reading facial expressions, but this is not a sign of a lack of empathy or emotion. I personally think Asperger's kids have emotions but have difficulty expressing them.2: The "Needing Explanation" thing. This is something that effects me in everyday life, I might hear a detail of a conversation that I don't understand and I need explaination sometimes, if I've never encountered a term or situation before.3: Taking things literally. I used to do this a lot when I was younger but as a young adult I'm more able to discern metaphors/sarcasm.There's plenty of other stuff that I could list in this review, but what I really need to point out is that although this book is a good starting point for understanding Asperger's (I previously called it absolute rubbish because it was nothing like me), it's worth recognising that it's not a cookie cutter guide to dealing with Asperger's children, as good the story is, it's not a professional piece of research on the condition, it is an attempt by a non-Asperger's author to create a character who convincingly portrays the characteristics of one example of Asperger's.Some of the other reviews by LT users I've read seem to think that Asperger's is a disease. It's not lethal, and it's not cancer. It's a condition that you live with if you're born with it. This is indeed an important and controversial book, and it probably didn't deserve the 1 star review I gave it previously. What really bugs me, when revisiting this book, is that like Christopher, many readers are taking the story literally as a definitive work on Asperger's, when they have no experience of it themselves or any experience of meeting Asperger's people.I give it Four stars this time because of a sunny disposition, and new eyes for a book I needed to give a second chance. </review>

	<review>One of the most breath-taking books I’ve read recently.  Christopher has Asperger’s Syndrome, which is mild autism, so of course he is completely unable to live in the real world of emotions.  Social interaction is impossible for him to fathom, so when he decides to investigate the apparent murder of the neighbours’ dog, he unravels his life in unforeseen ways.  Another young adult fiction that easily crosses over into adult fiction, because Chris is such a complex character.  He’s a brilliant mathematician, who also will bark like a dog in order to cope with unexpected (i.e. normal) issues in a public setting.  Some people in my book group hated this, but I thought it was terrific. </review>

	<review>This was a quick and enjoyable read that gives a rather accurate depiction of an autistic teenager.  The "autistic" qualities of the writing lend it a unique charm.  The layers of meaning (i.e., the actual events and the narrator's interpretation of them) bolster what would have been a blander story if told from a different perspective.  I found Christopher's dream of a "perfect world" haunting and beautifully obscene. </review>

	<review>I found the book fascinating. To be privy to Christopher's mind was an interesting experience. People take so many things for granted - social cues, the ability to filter out unnecessary details of scenery, understanding emotions like grief and happiness and when someone's lying to you. Being hugged and liking being hugged. Here, we have a boy who comprehends none of these - and yet knows the prime numbers up to seven thousand something, understands probability questions that baffle Math PhDs and does complex quadratic equations in his head. Having the book narrated from his perspective can be quite an eye-opener - especially when he rattles off every sign he sees at the train station and explains everything in a step-by-step process instead of just giving you the gist of it. I can see how it would be difficult living in a world that expects people to have a clue.Time-tables and rules order his world, down to the last minute; emotions and feelings, not so much - these he reduces to mathematical formulae to make better sense of them. Instructions have to be precise and phrases like "Keep off grass" baffle him because it doesn't tell you which grass to keep off - the grass surrounding the sign, or all the grass in the park (frankly, that has baffled me too, many a time.) His world is built on honesty and truth, which is why he doesn't comprehend white lies and the use of god (I love this kid).I even enjoyed the math and the science trivia he threw in there, and his quirky descriptions of insignificant elements to the story like the advertisement board at the station because his teacher tells him a good book needs descriptions. The Monty Hall Problem was fascinating - I get it and I don't get it at the same time - but it's all clear in his head. And the spiral method of finding a place that you know you're close to, but not sure where it is - ingenious.The book also does a good job of showing how his parents' cope with having him. His mother's frustrations and his father's quiet patience are very real. You feel compassion for them - it's hard not to be able to hug your kid when you want to, or have him scream when you go shopping because he doesn't like crowds and you know it's not a temper-tantrum. It was heart-warming to read about his father trying to mend bridges toward the end, and though you want to hate the mother for abandoning him, you can understand why she did what she did, even if you don't agree with it.In the end everything's ok. Christopher's world moves on smoothly, despite the hiccups with the dead dog, and his family problems, but he has his time-table, he will write his A-levels and he will add red food colouring to his food so he doesn't have to deal with yellow or brown. It all works out for him. Another reviewer found this disturbing - how everything is wrapped up for Christopher. But I don't know - I actually like that with everything else going on in his head, stuff that would break many of us hardly fazes him. </review>

	<review>I read this adult novel years ago and re-read it this weekend. Our faculty book club is discussing it tomorrow so I needed to refresh my memories of it! And I'm glad I did.Reasons why I like this book:1. It's written from the perspective of a teenage boy who has autism.2. It's a mystery and a family drama all rolled together.3. The reader has to read between the lines to figure out what's going on.4. Gotta love the math.5. It makes me thankful to have the life I lead.I do have one complaint about this novel though. I had forgotten about how the ending disappointed me the first time. Everything wraps up just fine from the narrator's perspective, although I guess everything is fine from his point of view. And that's the troubling thing. As long as Christopher's schedule isn't too disruptive, his life is okay. Even if parents are switching on him, pets are dying, and things are yellow. </review>

	<review>In sintesi Christopher è un quindicenne colpito dal morbo di Asperger, una forma di autismo. Ha una mente straordinariamente allenata alla matematica ma assolutamente non avvezza ai rapporti umani: odia il giallo, il marrone e l'essere sfiorato. Ama gli schemi, gli elenchi e la deduzione logica. Non è mai andato più in là del negozio dietro l'angolo, ma quando scopre il cane della vicina trafitto da un forcone capisce di trovarsi di fronte a uno di quei misteri che il suo eroe, Sherlock Holmes, era così bravo a risolvere. Inizia così a indagare... La recensione di IBS Un ragazzino con gravi problemi di relazione, la misteriosa morte di un inerme cane barbone, un originale libro giallo, una madre scomparsa in circostanze poco chiare: sono questi gli ingredienti del fortunato romanzo di Mark Haddon, scrittore e illustratore di libri per ragazzi, che ha conquistato le vette delle classifiche dei best seller negli Stati Uniti e in Inghilterra. Questo libro segna il suo originale esordio nel campo della narrativa rivolta al pubblico adulto. È un giallo diverso dai consueti, caratterizzato da una trama intrigante al punto giusto, seria ma allo stesso tempo divertente, che cattura sin dalle prime pagine l’attenzione dei lettori. Particolare è la figura del protagonista, il giovanissimo Christopher Boone, affetto da una grave forma di autismo che lo isola da tutto e da tutti ma non gli impedisce di sviluppare una forte passione per le storie gialle di Sherlock Holmes e una straordinaria capacità deduttiva. Grazie a questa sue capacità, il ragazzino che odia essere toccato, che non riesce a interpretare le espressioni del viso degli altri e non sorride mai, intraprende un’avventura che non ha nulla da invidiare a quelle del suo celebre eroe letterario. Inizialmente la sua indagine si concentra sulla triste fine del cane Wellington ma ben presto comincia a far luce su un mistero che lo tocca molto da vicino: la scomparsa della madre. Durante le sue ricerche scopre infatti alcune recenti lettere della donna, che credeva morta, e ricostruisce un complicato groviglio di relazioni fra i suoi genitori e la coppia dei vicini… Romanzo intenso e commovente, Lo strano caso del cane ucciso a mezzanotte ha il pregio di trattare con delicatezza un tema difficile come l’handicap psichico. Lo stile, lieve e intrigante, è vivacizzato dalle illustrazioni che si alternano al testo scritto e dal tono colloquiale del racconto, che nasce dalla voce dello stesso protagonista intento a ricostruire, mossa dopo mossa, il suo percorso di scoperta. Il risultato è una storia di formazione, adatta anche al pubblico dei più giovani; un libro di piacevole lettura, caratterizzato da verosimiglianza e intensità, che, oltre al divertimento, offre la possibilità di avvicinarsi a una realtà di disagio e difficoltà.</review>

	<review>Notes:Told from the perspective of 15 year old Christopher this mystery of sorts plunges the reader into the world of autism. Christopher lives anexsistence riddled by math and rules to learn. His ordinary life experinces are genuinely depicted as he copes with his mother leaving the family, his neighbors and interactions at school. This is a must read for any teachers in contact with students who suffer from Asperger's or any variation of autism. It is a compassionate tale that shed light on an often ignored subject with great humor.</review>

	<review>Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time was a refreshing read. I feel as though the ending was a bit rushed, and I would have been okay with the chapter 233 being expanded to say, 523. But I also realize that the story about Wellington was over, and Mark Haddon's editor might have said that most readers wouldn't stick with the story that long. (The book is not long at all, 221 pages plus an appendix. The chapters are numbered only as primes, which made the book feel completely authentic as written by an autistic boy.)I found myself loving Christopher but also realizing how hard it would be to parent him. I wanted to hate his mother and father for their choices, but I couldn't bring myself to that level. A nice balance was struck by the author throughout. </review>

	<review>One mark of a great novel is if it thrusts you into the mind of the protagonist, so that you feel you truly are that person, you experience what they experience, the way that they experience it, and having finished the book, sit back and think, "Whoa." How brilliant, then, is a novel about an adolescent who actually is incapable of that precise experience, of understanding another's soul? the curious incident of the dog in the night-time is just that sort of book. It takes you inside of the mind of a 15 year old with autism, and brilliantly pulls back the curtain of what goes on inside someone who can do calculus in his head to relax, but is overwhelmed to the point of semi-consciousness at being in a crowded train station. But this is no dry documentary. Instead, it is the intriguing story of the young man's search for answers, nimbly displaying the humanity, in all the twists and imperfections, of a variety of people in his life. As you follow Christopher and the unfolding plot along, you are entertained, challenged, and provoked to think a little more deeply about humanity and the nature and limitations of human thought and response. My only detraction of the novel is in its liberal use of profanity, which as in most novels is supposed to be "realistic" but ended up for me only being distracting. An entertaining and provoking read. </review>

	<review>Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It isn't common for me to enjoy a best-seller as much as I did this one, but this is a very unusual book. When I read reviews, I'm struck by the inevitable use of "funny," "humorous," and the like to describe the read. It goes against the nature of the protagonist to think of this book as anything like funny. If Christopher could speak from beyond the last page, he would insist the story isn't funny because he can't tell jokes since he doesn't understand them. It is most irritating to have people think you are funny when you know you are not. I don't think this is a funny book, though it did make me smile. It makes me smile because it is natural to smile when you like someone, and I like Christopher very much. </review>

	<review>In Great Britain this book was published as a young adult book and an adult book. It has two different covers. In the U.S. this book was only published as an adult book. I mention this bit of trivia because the oversight by its U.S. publisher could cost the book a Printz medal, which requires that a foreign book have an American version published in the same year of eligibility. The Printz committee may decide that the “American version” must be a designated YA version. I am hoping that the Printz committee overlooks the American publisher’s oversight and awards this book the Printz medal. This is the finest book I’ve read this year. The format is innovative and it adds to the message. It also has the distinction of making math sound like a life saving endeavor (complete with proofs!). Call this book a Sherlock Holmes meets Asperger’s syndrome. Christopher Boone is 15 and autistic. He can’t eat food that touches on his plate and he loves prime numbers. Christopher hates metaphors and loves similes. He sees a dead dog in his neighbor’s yard. It has been stabbed with a garden fork. Christopher decides to emulate Sherlock Holmes and solve the mystery of dead poodle Wellington. His search is hilarious, maddening, poignant, and always riveting. Readers will scream in the train station. The voice in this book is as close to perfect as human’s can come in written pages. The characterization of Christopher’s dad and mom are so human, we swear we know them. If you don’t read any other book this year, pick up this one! A MUST READ BOOK! </review>

	<review>The curious incident of the dog in the night-time is a book based on a boy trying to find out who murdered his neighbors dog. He is very nosy and is desperate to find out who did this act.

	<review>Reading this book is like taking a walk in the park. The story's flowing, and it also serves as an interesting account of a boy suffering from Asperger's syndrome. It's a very cute storyline too, but other than that, it's nothing exceptional. </review>

	<review>I really enjoyed reading this book, which I just finished yesterday. Although I found the beginning very slow, the story grabbed me eventually and kept me reading, the plot picking up steam as the book moved on. The simplicity of the language was executed very well. Although it slowed my reading down, it really made me consider what I was reading, as opposed to quicker-but-might-miss-some-details approach to reading that I usually take. This book made me understand much more clearly the behavior that I see but don't often understand in autistic individuals. Reading this book, Christopher's reactions and behavior seemed to make sense. The language was such that I felt a part of him or as though I was in his head. The plot was clever and endearing, and the fact that it was set in England made me appreciate it a hundred times more. Kudos to Haddon for his understanding of autism, and for the ease with which he was able to translate it into easily readable, comprehensive yet uninsulting and non-abrasive novel. His appreciation for the individuals is apparent. </review>

	<review>3876.  The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, by Mark Haddon  (read 12 Apr 2004) This fictional account of a 15-year-old autistic boy begins somewhat boringly but about one-third of the way through one is caught up by it, and develops a great deal of empathy for the boy, so grossly ununderstandable to his parents and to those in contact with him.  An engrossing and most worthwhile book. </review>

	<review>Absolutely brilliant book about a boy with the asperger syndrome.Haddon seems to have done a lot of research for this book and I am completely convinced that I know more about the syndrome than I did before.To stress my point, this is the only book I have read twice in a few years. </review>

	<review>Christopher Boone is taking his A-level mathematics exams, does not tell jokes, will not eat any food that is yellow or black, and creates flow charts to make decisions. He is a typical fifteen-year-old, but one diagnosed with autism. Finding a murdered dog in his neighbor's front yard prompts him to begin investigating and writing a book as if he was Sherlock Holmes. This book leads Christopher to some disturbing revelations about the death of his mother and sends him on a very frightening and over-stimulating journey to London to solve the mystery. First-time novelist Haddon captures the confusing, analytical, unemotional world of autism in her endearing narrator. Christopher relates events as a newspaper reporter, but readers will applaud his tenacity and empathize with his family issues. When he says, "I was brave and I wrote a book and that means I can do anything," he leaves the reader convinced that he can and will. Students interested in math and physics will appreciate Christopher's chapters solving math problems and looking at hypothetical graphs about frogs in a pond, and everyone will cheer for Christopher as he emulates his hero, Sherlock.

	<review>I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and felt an affection for Christopher Boone that surprised me.  He's quirky, as Asperger's Syndrome people are, and his personality resonates throughout the book.  His persistence with trying to solve the mystery of the murder of his neighbor's dog is charming and witty.  Of course the side story about his mom's death holds the whole story together, and the ending is wonderful.  I'd like to see Christopher's story continue. </review>

	<review>To quote from the review of the audiobook in KLIATT, January 2004: This truly original and engaging story is told in the first person by Christopher Boone, a 15-year-old with Asperger's Syndrome. An autistic-savant, Christopher is effectively imprisoned by self-imposed rules and a private logical order. Out of tune with ordinary life, he is oblivious to the crisis in his home and obsessed with finding out who killed the dog next door. Solving this mystery is only half the story and only the beginning of Christopher's journey. Award-winner Haddon reinvigorates the traditional Bildungsroman, the novel of transition from childhood to adulthood, depicting with realism the richness, the limitations and the unbearable pain of Christopher's world as Christopher experiences it. Category: Paperback Fiction. KLIATT Codes: SA*--Exceptional book, recommended for senior high school students, advanced students, and adults. 2003, Random House, Vintage Contemporaries, 226p., $12.00. Ages 15 to adult.(Jacqueline Edwards, Kliatt Review, July 2004, Vol. 38, No. 4)Won: Children's Book of the Year Winner 2004 United KingdomThis review has been flagged by multiple users as abuse of the terms of service

	<review>This was a cute, quirky fun quick read. The story is unusual because it's written from the point of view of a fifteen year old autistic boy. However, the novel is definitely well done and I would recommend it to anyone, of any age, because the story is well-written and highly accessible, but that's not why I like this book.I like this book, because it is written from the point of view of an autistic child and I have an unabashed interest in bizarre neurological disorders that result in some sort of weird talent. (In this case, it's math skills.) While, autism isn't quit synesthesia, I still think it's utterly fascinating to read about, so I liked the book even more.Anyway, I think this is a good summer pool-side read, if any of you are in the market for such a book. </review>

	<review>Christopher is 15 and goes to a special school he has great difficulty interpreting human behaviour, relationships and gestures. Now this is not unusual for a boy of 15 but the dust jacket of the book says he has asperger's syndrome. He has unusual mathematical ability and a photographic memory. The story is from his persective, a very good read and wonderfully insightful. </review>

	<review>An amazing read. Couldn't put it down. Illuminating and heart rending in the extreme, but all presented so purely that you simply accept the facts in the same way as the protagonist has to. But other characters are reflected like mirrors off the boy and you are required to understand and interpret their pain and frustration through his plain description - making it all the more piercing. </review>

	<review>People either love or hate this book. I thought Haddon did a brilliant job of showing the world through the words of a 15-year old autistic boy. Through description and dialogue that the narrator, Christopher, doesn't fully understand yet still reports faithfully, the reader gets the full story. Christopher doesn't understand emotion, but the reader does, because his description of people's reactions shows us.Christopher goes off on tangents that seem unrelated to the text, but as you read between the lines you realize that though he doesn't understand emotions he does feel them, and his monologues about math, religion, and the universe can be seen as analogies of his emotional frame of mind. </review>

	<review>This is worth reading. While clearly challenging to write, with this simple story the author has attempted, albeit in vain, to narrate as an autistic   youth from a dysfunctional family. While no-one can ever really tell if it's any where near accurate, it's interesting all the same. The plot is a little dysfunctional too, but that's of less importance to some of us. Mr Haddon can clearly write and has offered something interesting here that is well worth the effort. </review>

	<review>An autistic boy named Christopher finds a neighbor's dog murdered and decided to solve the mystery. The bigger mystery is what happened between Christopher's parents. I absolutely detested this book. I know that Haddon was trying to represent how an autistic person thinks, but it seemed like the narrator was on crack or something. He jumped from topic to topic, causing the book to be very disjunct. The plot got lost many times and it was just painful to read. I had to force myself to finish it. </review>

	<review>This book is pure delight. The main character is a fifteen year old autistic boy named Christopher, and he is one of the most unique narrators that I have ever read.Given an assignment at his school to write a story, Christopher decides to write a real life mystery about who killed his neighbors dog. He looks at the world in ways that most of us never will. So while he goes about 'detecting,' he records and observers things going on around him (both funny and heartbreaking at the same time) that he doesn't begin to comprehend. One of the best books I've read in along time. </review>

	<review>I picked this book up because I heard great things about it. This is not the typical type of book I would read, but I was pleasantly surprised. The book deals with a young autisitc boy who tries to solve the murder of a dog. The author does a great job of not only getting in the head of a young man, but of an autisitc one. Part myster, part human interest story, there are some touching moments and some humorous ones. It was an easy, enjoyable read. </review>

	<review>A very interesting novel written from an autistic boy's point of view. I thought it did a great job of showing how some children with autism might think. While it does not give a wholly medical description of autism, I think that's ok. Every person is different and I really think that Haddon did a good job with his character, Christopher. I especially think it's important to point out that Mark Haddon worked with autistic individuals in his youth and probably has more insight into their thinking than most people.For a child used to simple schedules, the book takes Christopher through a rocky period of his life when he is trying to find out what is going on. He has realized that nothing is right, a dog is dead and his father gets angry, but when he investigates the dog's murder he finds more than anyone could expect. </review>

	<review>This must have been an easy "novel" for Mark Haddon to write. You think up a character and give him a common disorder, but despite his shortcomings he still seems to be smarter than regular beings--he is an idiot-savant (the common perception of autistic people)! Then, you give him a factual mind frame that lacks of basic human emotions such as compassion and pretend to write from his point of view. </review>

He detests the color yellow, believes good and bad days are dictated by cars on the road, and has savant-like qualities when it comes to countries and their capitals and prime numbers.  When a neighbor dog is murdered, Christopher will stop at no end to find out who murdered him.  Upon finding out his father was the murderer, Christopher runs away in search of his mother who deserted him and his father when she couldn't handle raising Christopher. </review>

	<review>Excellent insight into the psyche of a person suffering from autism. The contrast of a great intellect with such a complete lack of social skills is hard to grasp.  I would recommend this book to anyone who knows  someone suffering from this malady- which is probably most of us- and it would generate compassion for the caregivers as well as the sufferer..

	<review>This book took me about a day to read - it was easy and fast-paced. Personally, I thought it was a brilliant and heart-wrenchingly real portrayal of a 15 year old boy with Asperger's Syndrome. It doesn't give you the usual human sympathies and fulfilments that characters in normal novels do. You feel raw, steely, and shocked. The language used is brutally real and shows the inner-workings of a damaged mind with such detail and preciseness, it really gives the story a huge aspect of realism. 15-year old Christopher, living in his own world, has it turned upside-down when he finds his neighbour's dog dead in her garden, and decides to find out who killed it. Everything he took as normal and regular and fact is then put into question. And because it is told from Christopher's point of view, the reader figures out pieces of the mystery far before Christopher does. But that doesn't make in uninteresting - Christopher is constantly writing abouts maths and physics, and the fact that he is writing a book (with the help and encouragement of his school teacher) - his long, unpunctuated senteneces and telling of events without emotion or feeling produces a strong, well-shaped voice. The book, to me, served it's purpose very well. It got me to think about something I would never have otherwise thought about - what goes on inside the mind of a person with AS - and why they might do some of the things they do. I think it was worthy of being as acclaimed as it was. </review>

	<review>Having dealt with kids who were autistic as I was growing up, I found Mark's book to be extremely real. It was also very hard to put down.I have heard many mixed reviews on his book, and know when I suggest it to people I let them know that they will either love it or hate it. I loved it. </review>

	<review>I so wanted to love this book, especially after having a few recommendations from people who had already read it.  Unfortunately though, I found it irritating and boring, and difficult to engage with any of the characters.Christopher is a 15 year old boy who has Asberger's Syndrome.  When his neighbour's dog is killed, he sets out to find the perpetrator, and ends up on the journey of his life. </review>

	<review>A fun read in an odd kind of way. The only POV is Christopher Boone, who has Asperger's Syndrome, one of the range of autistic disorders that means there is little or any emotional connection. He struggles to understand other people, but has a very high faculty for remembering details. How accurate this is is almost impossible to say. I don't find it wholely consistant through the book which is annoying, the police are particularly shallowly cast. As can be imagined living with such a child is extremely difficult, and the book features Christopher and his tolerant dad, coping with his mum's abscense. The emotional ties are tricky for him to understand sufficiently to even ask sensible questions. Christopher's attention to detail is also reflected in a painstakingly logical mind, as such one of his 'heros' is Sherlock Holmes - this displays a poor understanding of Sherlock who seldom actually uses any logical deductions - but the interludes of items that Christopher finds of interest are worthwhile, mathmatical puzzles normally. Quite why a chapter appears devoted to evolution isn't so obvious. Overall an enjoyable and quirky read, let down by the details of ordinary life around Christopher. This book was a major media sensation and raised the profile of Asperger's considerably. </review>

	<review>Uplifting and intelligent in an at first straightforward-seeming treatment of some heavyweight ideas. The premise may seem overly contrived to someone reading a jacket flap, but the young narrator's voice speaks strong  clear to a great many of the complexities of childhood, growing up and being human. The titular 'Curious Incident' sets our protagonist off an an enjoyable and enlightening roller coaster ride of an adventure and discovery - funny, touching and ultimately satisfying. </review>

	<review>A little too close to home.  Along with my suspicion some of this may be genetic in my family, and my wife joked this book was about me. I think it might be hard to read this and now have some visceral reaction.  I swung back and forth between being incredibly sorry for the boy and also being like, yes! I understand exactly why you do it that way.  A story of courage.  I wish it was longer -- but peectly wrapped and delivered. </review>

	<review>I was unsure of what this book would be like when I picked it up and I was hesitant to buy it. That being said I am glad that I did. This book is the book that Christopher wanted to write, so it's from the perspective of a 15 year old autistic boy. If one is familiar with autism then this book makes all of the sense in the world. If unfamiliar, then this book may seem a bit disjointed at times, but that's just the way that his mind works. Nonetheless it is a very sad and cute story. The author did a great job of giving us those little quirks and special abilities that one would see in a high functioning (Asperger's) autistic child. Christopher loves Sherlock Holmes, animals, and his "maths" were he is very gifted, he can make and follow maps in his head. He is not very emotionally attached to people, hates the colors yellow and brown, and has many other dislikes including liars. Another great touch from the author was to number the chapters according to prime numbers. This book was unexpectedly good. </review>

	<review>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time by Mark Haddon is a fascinating and thoroughly engrossing novel for all readers, but particularly those who want to get a better understanding of Autism Spectrum Disorder. In this book, the reader gets the unique opportunity to view the world from inside the mind of a 15-year old boy with Asperger Syndrome (i.e., a high-functioning autistic). The plot is brilliant and unpredictable. I read the book in one day and could barely keep myself away from it. It is set in the present in a small English town, about 100 miles from London. The book is told entirely from the voice of the boy, Christopher Boone. In the beginning, the boy discovers his neighbor’s dog, Wellington, dead in the yard with a garden fork piercing its body. This starts him on a detective hunt to uncover who killed the dog. The journey takes many unexpected twists and turns. In the end, the boy has gained a far better understanding of the world and his ability to deal with it. Highly recommended. </review>

	<review>I adored it. The second half of the book is not quite as interesting as the first, but the purpose of the story is to fall in love with the protagonist, Christopher, which I did almost immediately due to his explanation of why he prefers dogs to people: "...dogs are faithful and they do not tell lies because they cannot talk." Christopher is often profound in his simple observations of human behavior, while at the same time frustrating, due to his lack of understanding how his behavior affects others. What I did find interesting was his daydream about most of the world being suddenly killed off, except for others like him who would leave him alone. I found it oddly endearing that he would not simply kill off the entire population, that on some subconscious level he still wanted companionship of a sort. This may not be the best book I've ever read, but Christopher is definitely one of my all-time favorite characters now. And I can't believe this is a first novel. I'm impressed. I intend to pick up Mark Haddon's next work immediately. </review>

	<review>This is a really thought provoking book, and not just as a window into aspergers syndrome, but also for commenting on how any of us make sense of the world. The 'favourite things' and 'dislikes' that Christopher has e.g. hates anything yellow, doesn't like food touching on his plate, are just heightened aspects of the favourites and dislikes of those of us without the syndrome. His determination to go to London and the description of the ways he coped with the journey in a unfamiliar setting was inspiring. </review>

	<review>This book is a story of Christopher who is a " special child " with photographic memory, magical calculation abilities etc, but unable to understand other people, their feelings and social norms. The story, in the first person, tells us of an incident in his life, in the background of a disturbed family and problems between his parents. The narrative is fascinating since it is from the perspective of this child with autism, but the plot and the story leaves much to be desired. It is a good and fast read, makes you think about how our brain works and how Christopher's brain works, and how it is so intriguingly similar and different at the same time. On the whole however, I won't term this work an enjoyable read - it leaves you with the feeling that it could have been better somehow.From  my reviews page  </review>

	<review>You know, I actually expected a lot from this book, given all the hype it was receiving. Even Arthur Golden, author of one of my new favorite book Memoirs of a Geisha (next), loved it. So why was I not amazed? Don’t get me wrong, it started out promising. It was just so original, and the tell-it-like-it-is style in the point of view of Christopher Moore, a fifteen-year-old autistic kid, was excellent, especially since it captures the essence of the relationships in the novel perfectly. I think the end felt a little flat for me. Not as great as I thought it was going to be, but excellent nonetheless. </review>

	<review>From Publishers WeeklyChristopher Boone, the autistic 15-year-old narrator of this revelatory novel, relaxes by groaning and doing math problems in his head, eats red-but not yellow or brown-foods and screams when he is touched. Strange as he may seem, other people are far more of a conundrum to him, for he lacks the intuitive "theory of mind" by which most of us sense what's going on in other people's heads. When his neighbor's poodle is killed and Christopher is falsely accused of the crime, he decides that he will take a page from Sherlock Holmes (one of his favorite characters) and track down the killer. As the mystery leads him to the secrets of his parents' broken marriage and then into an odyssey to find his place in the world, he must fall back on deductive logic to navigate the emotional complexities of a social world that remains a closed book to him. In the hands of first-time novelist Haddon, Christopher is a fascinating case study and, above all, a sympathetic boy: not closed off, as the stereotype would have it, but too open-overwhelmed by sensations, bereft of the filters through which normal people screen their surroundings. Christopher can only make sense of the chaos of stimuli by imposing arbitrary patterns ("4 yellow cars in a row made it a Black Day, which is a day when I don't speak to anyone and sit on my own reading books and don't eat my lunch and Take No Risks"). His literal-minded observations make for a kind of poetic sensibility and a poignant evocation of character. Though Christopher insists, "This will not be a funny book. I cannot tell jokes because I do not understand them," the novel brims with touching, ironic humor. The result is an eye-opening work in a unique and compelling literary voice.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc. </review>

	<review>A cynic would assume this got so many good reviews because it's about a retarded child. The book suffers from a yawning credibility gap when it comes to its pivotal discovery. Why doesn't the mother just ring her son up? Or go to his school? Or pop round the house? It's not as if her son has gone anywhere. And when it comes down to it, a child's train trip just isn't that exciting. The book has its plusses, but it spends too much time in its hero's head. It's far too slight and the ending made me cringe. </review>

	<review>This is the story of an autistic and OCD teen who starts out trying to solve a murder mystery. Instead, he ends up making a journey of a lifetime and at the same time, learns something new about himself. This book is truly moving and sweet. I read it in an afternoon as I was completely drawn into the story. I would highly recommend this book. While it isn't your "ordinary, typical novel," it is a WONDERFUL read. http://iamagirldork.livejournal.com/1...http://www.bookcrossing.com/journal/4...</review>

	<review>I read this about 2 1/2 years ago and wrote some interesting thoughts down that make up this review.The book is a nice play on the detective story. It’s told from the point of view of a severely autistic uncomprehending 15-year-old, and the POV is brilliant, it makes the book. He decides to solve a neighborhood mystery, using the lessons of Sherlocke Holmes in The Hound of the Baskervilles. He narrates, and we see everything only through his eyes, a stilted autistic lens where power of observation is in the details while the big picture is a gaping hole. So, essentially the whole atmosphere becomes a mystery which we struggle to understand; the details are our only clues. The narrator’s autism also sets an interesting tone. He uses language that barely betrays any emotion. But the emotion is there. It’s a fascinating commentary on autism, on how intelligent and reasonable this boy is, and yet a train ride to London is a life threatening, harrowing adventure. And on how his relationships are so painfully difficult. No touching, no appreciation of what we might consider truly great things, because it’s all too complicated and miserable. Instead, his pleasure comes only from routine and predictable things. When things make sense, and are calm, the calmness itself is pleasurable. On the flip side this POV is maybe the most authentically non-judgmental objective point of view there is. This boy is the perfect vehicle for a dry, detached social commentary. Through him, the world is what it is, and the rest is totally up to the reader’s opinions. </review>

	<review>An interesting, intriguing and carefully crafted first novel. The main character is 15 year-old Christopher Boone, an autistic teenager, who sets out to discover who is responsible for the murder of his neighbour's poodle. As he undertakes this journey, he documents it by way of a journal (which is the book). Eventually he unearths the mystery of the murder, but not before undergoing some enormous and life-changing events. A wonderously written novel that will delight. </review>

	<review>Lack of empathy? Impaired social skills? Misreads social cues?  Well, here's what that means for 15 year-old Christopher:"This will not be a funny book.  I cannot tell jokes because I do not understand them.  Here is a joke, as an example.  It is one of Father's.'His face was drawn but the curtains were real.'I know why this is meant to be funny.  I asked.  It is because drawn has three meanings, and they are (1) drawn with a pencil, (2) exhausted, and (3) pulled across a window, and meaning 1 refers to both the face and the curtains, meaning 2 refers only to the face, and meaning 3 refers only to the curtains.If I try to say the joke to myself, making the word mean the three different things at the same time, it is like hearing three pieces of music at the same time, which is uncomfortable and confusing and not nice like white noise.  It is like three people trying to talk to you at the same time about different things.And that is why there are no jokes in this book."There are, however, ongoing variations to this basic theme.  Promoting psychological growth and change has little to do with one or another didactic model of social skills training.  Rather, it has much to do with being able to sing a duet with another who can grasp the basic  theme, and together being able to co-construct a new, unchained melody.</review>

	<review>This is an amusing book and is enjoyable for confident and unconfident readers alike. I would reccommend it for a teenager but older people will like it too. It is about a young boy with asperger's who becomes almost obsessed by the death of a neighbours dog and decides to investigate what happened. Really it is about his perception of the world and the people in it and the problems within his family.It is written asthough it is a piece of creative writing for his school teacher and includes lots of pictures, useless trivia and so on. I found it lost steam towards the end and the problems between his parents didn't really interest me. All in all I thought it was good but could have been better. </review>

	<review>I loved this book.  It was fun to read and insightful at the same time.  Shortly after reading it, I saw a TV show with parents of autistic children and it drove home how well Haddon had depicted Christopher.  Of course, I've always been a Sherlock Holmes fan, so that element of mystery and Christopher's love of Holmes was interesting as well.All in all, a fairly quick read, some plot turns, and gaining a better understanding of what goes on in the minds of some autistic people made this a terrific enjoyment! </review>

	<review>Christopher was a hand full, yet "over the moon" with intelligence.  It was marvelous to see how his mind worked.  I felt so sad for the dad.  He tried so hard and was so loving; whereas the mother's lack of patience; yet understanding gave her top billing.  She ran away with another man, the dad killed the man's dog with a pitch fork and told Christopher she had died.  Granted, that was bad, but this genious didn't really deal with "emotion," and therefore, felt safer with his mother, knowing his dad had lied to him and killed a dog. </review>

	<review>Christopher is 15 and lives in England with his dad. He begins this book to write a mystery novel about who killed his neighbour’s dog and ends up finding out much more about himself and his family.  He also has to undertake the journey of a lifetime for him – take a bus and a number of trains to London with only his pet rat for company. What is remarkable about this story is that it is told from the point of view of a person who has Asperger’s Syndrome / High functioning Autism. A compelling , sometimes sad; sometimes funny read about life through the eyes of a disabled person. Thought-provoking.</review>

	<review>The teenage protagonist suffers from Apsberger's Syndrome, an autistic spectrum disorder that prevents him for socializing normally and understanding others' emotions.  Haddon tells two stories here -- the first is the canine murder 15-year-old John Christopher attempts to solve, the second is the story of his attempt to navigate the wider world in spite of his handicap. Brilliant and original. </review>

	<review>This short novel written first person by an autistic teen-aged boy makes you feel as if you know what it's like to be autistic--or at least this particular autistic person.  And although terrible things happen, it still manages to be optimistic in a completely non-sentimental way.  Pretty impressive.  It's fast reading, but better done is short spurts because the style can get annoying in long stretches. </review>

	<review>This book is a set of journal entries of an autistic child, who uncovers some truths in the course of a detective pursuit.I quite liked this book - especially for the math and logic tidbits that the little kid keeps jotting down. For some reason it reminded me of Hitchcock's "Rear Window" - probably due to the amateur detective connection.It is definitely worth recommending for its creative style and interesting narrative, even though I personally did not feel that it brought out the "autistic" perspective too convincingly. </review>

	<review>The hero and first-person narrator is Christopher Boone, a teenager with eidetic memory and extraordinary mathematical talent. But he also has Asperger’s Syndrome, an autistic condition that separates him from the normal gamut of human emotions. The world he can cope with is one of facts, not fuzzy feelings.Christopher always tells the truth. Seeing through his eyes puts life into sharper focus, just as an extra, slightly off-centre light beam gives us holographic imagery. Oliver Sacks says of this novel: “A delightful and brilliant book. Mark Haddon shows great insight into the autistic mind…I found it all very moving, very plausible and very funny.” All true. </review>

	<review>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is a first-hand look on the world through autistic eyes; a bold, honest look at ourselves without the emotional fog that often blocks our view. Christopher had it tough, he was labeled right away as having Autism and immediately shoved under the 'disabled' category. Rather than embracing his gifts, society shunned him. Being treated the way he was made him look at everyone else in society in an experimental sort of way. He saw people as subjects of his own personal study of ‘normal’ human behavior. Since Christopher was told he was special, it made him wonder what was normal.	What surprised me about this book was the fact that Christopher was labeled as someone who didn’t understand emotion at all and couldn’t handle social situations, yet since he was so smart was able to learn what emotions he was supposed to feel. Our society is very quick to judge, we don’t give people a chance to change and like to find the easiest solution to everything. While perhaps Christopher didn’t completely understand how to use emotions correctly all the time	This novel shows very clearly how Christopher lived every day and how his life differs from ours. Also, through his eyes we see problems with our own society which is ironic in a way because in our society most people would see someone like Christopher as the one with the problem. I appreciate how the author flips that around and leaves us defenseless against the truth of our own actions.	 Christopher, even though he is a fictional character, has helped teach a lot of people many important lessons about how we need to sometimes take a step back and observe what is around us, take it all in, and apply it to how we act on a daily basis.  This would be a great book to recommend to anyone who would love to learn about the world in a whole new way, from fresh eyes, eyes maybe they didn’t even know existed. This is a great novel to introduce people to Autism and mental disorders in general; Mark Haddon does a wonderful job of putting himself in an autistic child’s shoes.</review>

	<review>The Curious Incident of the dog in the Night-time was a wonderfully original book that is very moving, I highly recommend it.  From the very beginning I loved being involved with and so in touch with the mind of a young autistic boy. This short novel is not only an elegant mystery but also a good experience, allowing the person reading it to be thankful for their health and family. Definitely a read that will stay with you. </review>

	<review>I was in Santa Barbra, eating at some restaurant, when I noticed a woman at the next table reading this book.  Later that night, in a bookstore, I noticed it in the New Arrivals section, and decided to buy it.  I had no idea what it was about, or that it would become a book everyone would start talking about in the next year, but I read it quickly, surprised at how different this book was than any other novel I had read before.    Now, I didn’t care for it as much as everyone did, but that’s not to say I didn’t enjoy it at all.  I liked the mystery of who killed the dog, why his mother had gone off, all the people’s problems and most of all, I loved the narrator’s point of view.  Because the main character had autism, the story was told in such a fresh way that it almost wasn’t boring.    This book is good, I guess.  Many people seem to love it, and it’s been on all the bestseller lists for a long time.  If you’ve found yourself in a rut from reading too many of a certain type of book (boring chick lit, travel/adventure, non-fiction), use this book to boost you out of it.  There’s pictures! </review>

	<review>When this book first came out, I dismissed it as a gimmicky work that would never stand the test of time. After weeks and weeks on the best seller lists, however, I finally decided to see what was making this little red title fly off the shelves. The book requires you to get past the somewhat implausible concept of a teenage autistic narrator named Christopher who writes with the simple precision of Hemingway. Once you swallow the concept (and you will), this odd narrator leads you through a moving detective story in which he uncovers some troubling family secrets while investigating the mysterious death of his neighbor's dog. This same story, told by an ordinary narrator, would be unremarkable. But using his love of math as a way of parsing through life's ambiguities and anchoring himself in a chaotic world, Christopher alternately wows you with his insights into how mathematical laws explain complex subjects like human evolution and then breaks your heart with his inability to complete everyday tasks like boarding a train. In the end, though, you may begin to question who is more balanced, the multitudes who carry on their lives without questioning what it's all about or this young autistic man who takes nothing for granted and lives true to his own logic-based code. -Kevin Joseph, author of "The Champion Maker" </review>

	<review>This was such a genuine story that it was a truly refreshing read. The author obviously knows a lot about those who live with autism. I, on the other hand, do not, but this book really made me put myself in their shoes. But it's not all doom and gloom or anything--I found the book hilarious as well. This is one of the best adult fiction books I've read in a while! </review>

	<review>When my SIL (who teaches ASD children) started suspecting my son was autistic, she did a brilliant thing.  She didn't suggest I get him tested.  She didn't list off all the symptoms of autism or Aspberger's.  She played on my love of books; she recommended this book to me.It was touching to look at the main character's loved ones through his eyes.  The story really is secondary to the character development.  This book as helped me understand my son more.  It has a nice side effect of helping me with my math students, too, by reminding me that all minds are not shaped the same way. </review>

	<review>One of those books to hit the "Tipping Point" and go over very quickly, a little like "The Da Vinci Code." For instance, is this really that much better a book than, say, "Animal Farm" or "Catch 22?" Without a doubt, the answer is no; and yet more LTers have this in their library.Still, that isn't to take away from a finely told story. Rarely has a mental illness been so dramatically, convincingly and sympathetically portrayed in fiction. </review>

	<review>"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time" is typical current book-club fare. The "novel" s to betries hard to be clever and different, however, it is a light-weight approach that rests on a single concept alone - much like the other books "customers who also bought this book bought" do, such as "The Time-Traveler's Wife" and "The Secret Life of Bees". This particular story attempts to portray the mind of a 15-year old boy with Asperger's syndrome (a type of autism) amidst a canine murder mystery. Ok, so the premise is interesting; however, the narrative quickly becomes too polished and "gimmicky" - polished in the sense that we soon become overly familiar and comfortable with the writing, and all the diagrams, lists, puzzles and other attempted corky interludes (such as an appendix with a complicated mathematical proof") soon just become tiresome gimmicks. It doesn't help that the main character is given most of the "stereotypical" autistic traits as often seen in movies such as Rainman. The murder mystery is "solved" half-way trough in a rather predictable manner and is simply the catalyst for a family mystery involving the parents. Thrown in at the second part of the book is an adventure story involving a trip, a chase and some family friction before the neatly tied-up ending that includes family harmony and a fluffy puppy...awwww... The only aspect I found mildly interesting were the conflicting notions of logic and superstition in the narrator's mind. He quickly and matter-of-factly discards any religious ponderings and is quite comfortable with his logic-induced atheism; however, his illogical superstitions regarding everything from "bad" colors to predicting a day's outcome based on the procession of cars he sees from the schoolbus are indeed quite amusing. Simplistic - yes, but at least there is some sense of conflict that doesn't come across as utterly contrived. All in all, it is a quick read; however, the impact doesn't linger much longer after the book club discussion is over... PS: the narrative is littered with various factual-sounding tidbits to show the boy's extreme capacity to memorize trivia, but a bit of caution is in order - the author (or editor) should have made sure these facts are indeed correct...for instance, the Vikings did not roam about 2000 years ago! The mathematical savant is off by a 1000 years... </review>

	<review>This story is told by 15 year old Christopher Boone, who is autistic. He discovers his neighbor's dog killed with a pitchfork and decides to solve this mystery. About halfway through the book, the dog's murderer is revealed and one of the hooks for the story is lost, but it sets up the plot for the second half of the story which was rather dark.I'm still scratching my head over this one. I was impressed with the idea for this book. It is an ambitious attempt to understand the workings of the autistic mind. The writing is overall good, and Christopher's voice is fresh, believable, engaging. The view of the world through his eyes is very enlightening and well presented. So why squander such a fully realized voice in a tired minimal plot populated by poorly drawn characters? The father, for instance, is key here, but we know so little about him. The mother and neighbors are also ciphers when they could have been so much more.It seems to me that the author invested a huge amount of work into creating one fine character and his unique voice, and then decided he didn't need to do any work on other parts of the book. And the voice is done so well, it carried me to the end of the book even though I felt disappointed in the end. </review>

	<review>Wow.  This is the kind of book that allows you to step out of your life and enter another's.  One very different and foreign from your own and actually think when it is over that you at least have a clue of what it is to be in that person's shoes.  The very essence of what I want a book to do. </review>

	<review>"Let's rustle up some tucker.""And now if I don't know what someone is saying I ask them what they mean . . ." This is a murder mystery. Most murder mysteries answer 2 questions: 1) Who did it? 2) Why did they do it? While those answers are often interesting, I'm not a big fan of the genre because the murderer never turns out to be the reader of the book. In real life, justice and the more enabling solutions are not found in simply finding someone else to blame, understanding their reasons for being destructive, and punishing them. It's more interesting to discover reasons to become more creative. This book is a well-motivated creative act. It is about the murder of a dog, which is unusual according to the narrator's therapist Siobhan "because readers cared more about people than dogs." But the narrator, a 15 yr old boy named Christopher, counters "I wanted to write about something real . . . and I cared about dogs because they were faithful and honest, and some dogs were cleverer and more interesting than some people." Christopher's father, Ed, warns him to "Keep your nose out of other people's business" and to not investigate who killed the dog. "It's a bloody dog, Christopher, a bloody dog." Christopher replies, "I think dogs are important, too." His father shouted, "I said leave it, for God's sake." But Christopher chooses not to leave it alone because it made him feel "happy, because I was being a detective and finding things out." Ed goes further, demanding that Christopher not mention Mr. Shears' name, not talk to Mrs. Shears, and not to ask anyone who killed that bloody dog. At first we don't know if Ed's moves to isolate and silence Christopher are protective. Only later do we find out his threats are primarily motivated by pride. The dog was an able comfort and support for Mrs. Shears. Sometimes Cain kills Able for his own proud reasons. And when Ed doesn't kill his perceived adversary, he cuts off communication (intercepting and prohibiting the exchange of letters) between two people who care about each other. This book is also about mathematics, basic cognitive building blocks, and prime numbers. Some people think this book is designed to give an autistic or Asperger's Syndrome perspective, but it is more universal than just that. The book is about trying to define basic things. Prime numbers are a symbol of basic, indivisible truths. As Christopher finds out, even prime numbers can be broken down, and sometimes answers to mysteries can be found in smaller fractions or more complex configurations. Christopher lays out his reasoning in simple diagrams, math equations, multiple choice options, and prose reasoning. He wants people to see his reasoning and judge it for themselves. He lacks inhibitions that would hide such things. We see where he makes reasoning errors. We see where he fails to grasp more options than he understands. One of my hopes in reading any new book is that the new ideas will cause me to go back and amend all my previous book reviews (you can do that here on Amazon). I walk away from this book being far more critical of the adults' behaviors  relationship choices than Christopher's. The adults try to use overly simple equations to solve real, complex problems and they end up being consistently angry, excluding, or violent. There is no solution in this novel until each of the 3 main characters forgive each other and find ways for all of them to be a part of each others' lives. It is a complex, inclusive solution. And the solution involves a dog - as so many good solutions do. "Father was standing in the corridor. He held up his right hand and spread his fingers out in a fan. I held up my left hand and spread my fingers out in a fan and we made our fingers and thumbs touch each other. We do this because sometimes Father wants to give me a hug, but I do not like hugging people, so we do this instead, and it means that he loves me." </review>

	<review>Amazon.comMark Haddon's bitterly funny debut novel, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, is a murder mystery of sorts--one told by an autistic version of Adrian Mole. Fifteen-year-old Christopher John Francis Boone is mathematically gifted and socially hopeless, raised in a working-class home by parents who can barely cope with their child's quirks. He takes everything that he sees (or is told) at face value, and is unable to sort out the strange behavior of his elders and peers.Late one night, Christopher comes across his neighbor's poodle, Wellington, impaled on a garden fork. Wellington's owner finds him cradling her dead dog in his arms, and has him arrested. After spending a night in jail, Christopher resolves--against the objection of his father and neighbors--to discover just who has murdered Wellington. He is encouraged by Siobhan, a social worker at his school, to write a book about his investigations, and the result--quirkily illustrated, with each chapter given its own prime number--is The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.Haddon's novel is a startling performance. This is the sort of book that could turn condescending, or exploitative, or overly sentimental, or grossly tasteless very easily, but Haddon navigates those dangers with a sureness of touch that is extremely rare among first-time novelists. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is original, clever, and genuinely moving: this one is a must-read. --Jack Illingworth, Amazon.ca From Publishers WeeklyChristopher Boone, the autistic 15-year-old narrator of this revelatory novel, relaxes by groaning and doing math problems in his head, eats red-but not yellow or brown-foods and screams when he is touched. Strange as he may seem, other people are far more of a conundrum to him, for he lacks the intuitive "theory of mind" by which most of us sense what's going on in other people's heads. When his neighbor's poodle is killed and Christopher is falsely accused of the crime, he decides that he will take a page from Sherlock Holmes (one of his favorite characters) and track down the killer. As the mystery leads him to the secrets of his parents' broken marriage and then into an odyssey to find his place in the world, he must fall back on deductive logic to navigate the emotional complexities of a social world that remains a closed book to him. In the hands of first-time novelist Haddon, Christopher is a fascinating case study and, above all, a sympathetic boy: not closed off, as the stereotype would have it, but too open-overwhelmed by sensations, bereft of the filters through which normal people screen their surroundings. Christopher can only make sense of the chaos of stimuli by imposing arbitrary patterns ("4 yellow cars in a row made it a Black Day, which is a day when I don't speak to anyone and sit on my own reading books and don't eat my lunch and Take No Risks"). His literal-minded observations make for a kind of poetic sensibility and a poignant evocation of character. Though Christopher insists, "This will not be a funny book. I cannot tell jokes because I do not understand them," the novel brims with touching, ironic humor. The result is an eye-opening work in a unique and compelling literary voice. </review>

	<review>Mark Haddon's portrayal of an autistic child and his observations of the world around him is spectacular.  I've worked with autistic children and I was floored at how accurate this novel is.  It's a must-read for any teacher -- I wish I had picked this book up sooner.  It reminds me so much of a child I worked with; I think I would have "clicked" with him a lot sooner had I read this book earlier. </review>

	<review>This novel, written as a journal of an autistic boy named Christopher, gives an intriguing view of the world as seen through the eyes of someone who lacks the social skills and ability to convey his feelings and emotions as most others can.  This novel is very insightful, and really provides a look into things that one may not notice, such as the horrible way some people treat Christopher, despite not understanding his condition and his genius with puzzles and math.  This novel is incredibly interesting, however the repetitive writing is tough to get through. </review>

	<review>BookListThe hero of Haddon's debut novel is 15-year-old Christopher Boone, an autistic math genius who has just discovered the dead body of his neighbor's poodle, Wellington. Wellington was killed with a garden fork, and Christopher decides that, like his idol Sherlock Holmes, he's going to find the killer. Wellington's owner, Mrs. Shears, refuses to speak to Christopher about the matter, and his father tells him to stop investigating. But there is another mystery involving Christopher's mother, who died two years ago. So why does Siobhan, Christopher's social worker, react with surprise when Christopher mentions her death? And why does Christopher's father hate Mrs. Shears' estranged husband? The mystery of Wellington's death begins to unveil the answers to questions in his own life, and Christopher, who is unable to grasp even the most basic emotions, struggles with the reality of a startling deception. Narrated by the unusual and endearing Christopher, who alternates between analyzing mathematical equations and astronomy and contemplating the deaths of Wellington and his mother, the novel is both fresh and inventive. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------KristineHuntley.From BookList, April 1, 2003, Copyright © American Library Association.

	<review>Amazon.comMark Haddon's bitterly funny debut novel, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, is a murder mystery of sorts--one told by an autistic version of Adrian Mole. Fifteen-year-old Christopher John Francis Boone is mathematically gifted and socially hopeless, raised in a working-class home by parents who can barely cope with their child's quirks. He takes everything that he sees (or is told) at face value, and is unable to sort out the strange behavior of his elders and peers.Late one night, Christopher comes across his neighbor's poodle, Wellington, impaled on a garden fork. Wellington's owner finds him cradling her dead dog in his arms, and has him arrested. After spending a night in jail, Christopher resolves--against the objection of his father and neighbors--to discover just who has murdered Wellington. He is encouraged by Siobhan, a social worker at his school, to write a book about his investigations, and the result--quirkily illustrated, with each chapter given its own prime number--is The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. </review>

	<review>I had no idea what this book was about when I first started reading it, but soon found myself interested in Christopher's story.  Christopher is an autistic teenager who decided to write a book and investigate the murder of his neighbour's dog, much like his literary hero, Sherlock Holmes.  Christopher's take on the world through autism is very interesting and though I have no experience in dealing with autism, I would assume it is pretty realistic based on what I know about an autisitc person's inclination towards math, order, and patterns.  I felt sympathetic towards his father and also admired him for giving so much to his son and knowing he will never get the usual signs of love that any parent expects and needs from their child.  At the same time, christopher makes no apologies for not being able to show affection towards his parents, simply because he does not realize or understand it. </review>

Ama gli schemi, gli elenchi e la deduzione logica. Non è mai andato più in là del negozio dietro l'angolo, ma quando scopre il cane della vicina trafitto da un forcone capisce di trovarsi di fronte a uno di quei misteri che il suo eroe, Sherlock Holmes, era così bravo a risolvere.

	<review>I work with autistic kids, so I was very interested to read this book. Unfortunately, there was something that didn't quite click for me with regard to the protagonist of this book. However, I do think this is an excellent insight to autism for people who have not had much contact with people who have autism. It is also an interesting story. </review>

	<review>Totally unique; totally readable.  It seems like a light story told in a light tone; only when you stop to think about it do you realize how heavy the story is, and how unique it is to see things from Christopher's perspective.  I know next to nothing about autism, but I found Christopher to be almost instantly relatable as a narrator - I liked that he was fairly self-aware about his thought processes, but that it wasn't a big melodramatic hand-wringing issue for him - it was just the way he was.  Very refreshing, subtly funny in spots, heart-wrenching in others; a quick, light (but not really) read. </review>

	<review>Christopher Boone is the autistic protagonist of this book.  Christopher likes routine, mathematics, dogs, and Sherlock Holmes novels.  When his neighbor’s dog is murdered, and he is incorrectly suspected as the killer, he decides to find out who did it, Sherlock-style, in both solving the mystery and writing it down.  This reflexive style is fascinating- I love Christopher’s perspective on not understanding facial expressions, idiomatic expressions like “raining cats and dogs,” and the way he spends idle time by solving math problems in his head, and actually including said problems in the text.  The book even has an appendix to show how he solved a particularly difficult question from an academic test he takes.  Christopher also deviates from the story line sometimes, usually in order to make an extended metaphor, and gives you interesting scientific or historical tidbits that were also fun to read.  This book is great.  I loved it. </review>

	<review>I'll admit that I'm not usually a fan of bookclub favorites.  This is an exception.  Haddon has written a clever, unique, quick read with believable characters and a mystery to tell the story of this young man.  It is a family with problems, but due to the main character's autism, it is not burdened with lengthy passages dripping with victimisation or emotional drivel.  There is no "why me?" or "poor me" in this touching coming-of-age tale.  I absolutely recommend it as a fabulous read, but not as an audiobook because the listening format would lose much of what makes the novel unique. </review>

	<review>One of the most unique and captivating books I have read. I am amazed at the insight that this author portrayed in depicting the thoughts and feelings of the main character, Christopher, a fifteen-year-old autistic boy. I was so involved with Christopher that it truly felt as if he was the one authoring this novel. It is not a fun story; there are many parts which are uncomfortable and even painful. But the journey is well worth the discomfort felt along the way. </review>

	<review>Christopher Swindon, a 16 year old boy with autism, decides to do some detective work in finding out who killed his neighbor's dog. He keeps a journal of his progress and this journal is essentially what you are reading. The whole book is in his narrative, which sometimes gets a little tedious, especially with the math solving sections. But other than that, Haddon did a great job developing Christopher's character and putting the reader in Christopher's mind to understand his actions and way of thinking. This book was definitely a great read and I would recommend it to mostly older teens and adults because of some of the language and situations in the story. </review>

	<review>I loved this book. It has one of the most original premises I have read in ages, and is so well executed it takes your breath away. Written from the POV of a 15 year old boy with Asperger’s Syndrome, it doesn’t immediately strike the potential reader as something that would appeal. But boy do we care about the protagonist, and when it looks as if he won’t be allowed to sit his maths A level we can feel his disappointment. Wonderful, wonderful stuff. Haddon thoroughly deserves the awards he’s won for this. </review>

	<review>Loved this book. My boss and friend Eugénie Olson gave it to me as a birthday present, and I devoured it in just over a week. I got half way through by reading it on the train going to and from work, then finished up with a couple of hours on the living room couch one rainy Saturday afternoon.Loaned it out to my sister-in-law Ginny at the first opportunity. </review>

	<review>The narrator and the main protagonist is a very quirky and logical kid. He's a fan of Sherlock Holmes but he hates A.C. Doyle. You have to hear his explanation. Overall, this book is unique, funny, and has kept me flipping from page to page. </review>

	<review>As a person on the autistic spectrum, I really enjoyed this book.  It was a fairly light book, but quite fun.  I particularly liked the numbering of chapters in only prime numbers.  It was a nice touch, and I once got in trouble for only numbering chapters in multiples of three! </review>

	<review>http://nhw.livejournal.com/117620.htm...Good stories are often told about unlikely events. The only bit that I found really challenged my suspension of disbelief was where the narrator successfully bought a train ticket and got on the train. But it was necessary for the plot, so I thought forgiveable. Otherwise a gripping and moving book. </review>

	<review>This was a neatly done little novel. Nice little detective element to it, nice work on the part of the author (it seemed) getting inside the head of the main character. I may have heard too many raves beforehand because I was not blown away or anything. It was a great character study, but it didn't offer much else to me. </review>

	<review>Granted, not a brilliant piece destined for classics, but it's purpose being singular the author has been effective. I'm not an expert, but I know of no other book which has created a sense of empathy for those who would otherwise not be able to understand how to deal with autism, or how autism feels to be dealt with. On this note, the author has ingeniously communicated about a subject humorously without being obscene. A word of warning however, this book was marketed to children, but it is not appropriate for children. To stay true to the author's point, "a murder mystery from the eyes of the narrator--an autistic boy" such things lie plainly within context. </review>

	<review>What a great read.  This book is written from the point of view of it's lead character who is a 14 year old boy with autism.  The story breaks your heart while making you laugh at the same time.  The innocence of the book is matched nicely with the complex story it narrates. </review>

Autistic people do tend to withdraw themselves to avoid unwanted stimuli. But autistic people can and do communicate and can be extremely intelligent. </review>

	<review>Very interesting read. I took a lot of it to heart becuase although, not dealing with what I presume is Asperger's syndrome, one of my children has sensory issues - and has issues with people touching her or noises or crowds and all things like that. It was interesting to read the characters perspective of it. It kind of reminds me to be patient with her when some of these things freak her out. And not only that, but the book was a great read aside from that. </review>

	<review>Sorry to those who liked this book but this book was a huge disappointment to me. While someone with no understanding of autism may be interested in some of the thoughts of the character, overall this book was slow, written with an insanely juvenile manner of speaking, and held little interest. It confirmed my belief that in taking the opinion of the majority of reviewers you will probably read a lot of books that you shouldn't waste your time on. Alternatively, I enjoyed 'The Speed of Dark' which is also a novel about autism and is a much better book.</review>

	<review>One of the best books I read in 2005. Already the fact that he only used prime numbers for the chapters won me over. You have to admire that. I actually admire everything about this book and the main character. It is so beautifully written and you really feel for this kid who himself doesn't feel at all. </review>

	<review>I was in love with this book from the first page. Literally. And like any love relationship, it ran into a fewsnags, but was overall a deeply enriching experience. Haddon's first novel is a deft handling of the story of a teenaged boy with Asperger's Syndrome, told from his point of view. Amazing that a book "told" by a person who doesn't understand humor can be so funny -- but the humor comes in with his emotionless, dry discussion of situations that are sometimes, honestly, not funny at all. And the book isn't all laughs, either; as the mother of a person with a tic disorder which manifests itself in some ways that are similar to the autism spectrum, I found that this reading was peppered with insights and "YES!" moments. </review>

	<review>I enjoyed this book because it relates the story of a person who is autistic and possessing brilliance in the areas of math and science.  Because it is written as if a book composed by the main character (with a special gift for remembering the exact details of people, conversations, and occurrences), it was different from everything I have read recently.  Additionally, the plot ended up being more complicated than I had originally anticipated, which is always fun. </review>

	<review>Haddon manages to tell the entire story through a stream-of-consciousness type voice, that of Christopher, a 15-year-old Austistic boy, without ever making it feel like a gimmick.  Christopher has found his neighbor's dog murdered, and he sets out in the tradition of his favorite detective, Sherlock Holmes, to not only find who did it but to write a book about it.  The story is not about the dog, though Christopher believes it to be, but  mostly about Christopher and the things that happen around him, and the ways in which the world reacts to him and him to the world.  It's fascinating, because the most interesting parts of the book happen in the background, and Haddon chooses -- wisely, in my opinion -- to stick to the voice he's created, to stick to the rules of Christopher's world, and thus to leave the readers without complete answers to every mystery.  Nicely illustrated.  I very much enjoyed this book. </review>

	<review>Fifteen-year-old Christopher Boone can name all the prime numbers up to 2000, can tell there are 60 circles on his teacher's shoes, can figure out it takes exactly 21 minutes to take the bus to school. Christopher has an inquisitive mind, keenness to numbers, unusual intuition of space, but he doesn't like anything yellow or brown. Christopher has Asperger's Syndrome, a condition similar to autism. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, unlike any book of fiction that I have read, deftly, but in very simplistic language that belongs to the voice of an autistic child, maps out Christopher's mind and emotions.When Christopher discovers that his neighbor's dog Wellington has been murdered with a garden fork, he skillfully applies his logical mind to probe the murder. Starting with neighbors on the same street, Christopher makes his inquiries but to no avail. His teacher Sihoban encourages him to keep all the clues that he has produced and discovered in a book which will eventually manifests into a book. When his father interferes at his investigation and locks up his journal, Christopher sets off a chain of events that unveil a shocking truth about his family. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is after all a book about trust, integrity and reconciliation. It verbalizes the mind of an autistic child and internalizes his thinking, bringing his fear and insecurity to full actuality. The book shows great insight to the meticulously, pristinely set of routines that is built on logic and mathematical equations that governs the protagonist's life. The writing is compulsively simple and unadorned. </review>

	<review>Before the I read the book, I read a bit about autism because I knew zilch about it. The main thing I got out of my five-minute research is that autistics are unable to "see through another person's eyes." In the book I could really see how that works.Haddon does a good job mixing Christopher's humor (which I'm sure he's unaware of) and sadness into the book, but sometimes the outcome of a particular situation in the story is too predictable. </review>

	<review>This novel really captured my attention with its unique prose and perspective.  It is a story told from the viewpoint of a 15-year-old Christopher Boone who has Asperger Syndrome, which is a form of high-functioning autism.  You really get a chance to see what his world is like, all the while getting the bonus of a good mystery with a smorgasbord of sad parts, funny parts, and triumphant parts.  I highly recommend this novel. It's a quick read, and it has a happy ending. </review>

	<review>This is a one-trick pony which uses a gimmick to tell a pedestrian and utterly unmoving story. All the critics had the wool pulled over their eyes on this one. The trick could have been used to great effect if any of the other characters around Christopher were worth caring about. Yes, the author makes us care about someone who shows and understands no emotion, but he doesn't have to with the flat and static characters around him. </review>

	<review>This is the first book I've purchased based on LibraryThing!  I was looking at "autism" tags, and saw that this was a popular book I hadn't heard of before.  I read it in 2 days and recommend it, coming from the perspective of a parent of a 3-year-old with similar developmental issues as the "narrator."  Having recently attended a conference focused on teaching emotional relationship skills to people with autism, I was captured by how accurately the author portrayed the character and his relationship with the people and the world around him.  A compelling read and interesting story to boot.</review>

It was amazing to read what this autistic boy might have been thinking and the tactics he used to shut out things around him.  If you liked this book too, you might enjoy "Someone not quite her mother" by Harriet Scott Chessman.  The paragraphs written from the Alzheimer's patient's viewpoint were equally moving for me.</review>

	<review>To me, one of the most interesting things about this book is that I liked it, having no experience at all with autism, and that I've also had it recommended by people with autistic family members.  That makes me feel better about what I got out of the book, knowing that Haddon got it right enough for people who know to think it's accurate. </review>

	<review>Another book well received by our book group. We all found it moving and empathised with the main character - which was quite a feat for the author: to portray someone with autism who is emotionally detached from all around him, yet make him sympathetic and likeable. Mark Haddon succeeds emphatically. I found out a lot about autism and aspergers from reading this book and material suggested by it. </review>

	<review>Christoper knows all prime numbers up to 7,057. He loves animals but cannot stand being touched. He is autistic. The novel is in the form of "novel", written by a 15 year old autistic boy. Very good. </review>

	<review>I really didn't know anything about this book before I started it - other than there had been some hype when it came out, and it had some obscure link to Sherlock Holmes.  I quickly realized that it was something special.  And I mean that in multiple ways.  I love the little diagrams, the chapters only prime numbered,  the finger touch hugs, the innocence and brilliance of the character.  A lovely book and a curious window into autism. </review>
