   <rev:text><![CDATA[This collection of stories represents some of Calvino"s best early work (the stories were originally compiled in two books from 1949 and 1958). Those who have read "The Baron in the Trees" (from 1957) will recognize the style at work here. The book burgeons with short stories, 28 in all divided into four sections, and each one includes a discovery of some sort as well as a reflection on the most bizarre of human emotions: love.
The stories contained in the book"s first section, "Riviera Stories", seem to have political subthemes. Many deal with the haves and have nots and their interactions. "The Enchanted Garden" tells of two children that happen along a seemingly deserted villa to discover a utopia or a dystopia - are the people who live in such luxury happy?; "A Goatherd at Luncheon" explores the gaps between the rich and the poorer classes when the man of the house invites the goat herder to lunch; In "Big Fish, Little Fish" a very capable young diver comes across an astonishing motherload of fish along with a sobbing sunbather who says she"s "unlucky in love", but every fish the boy pulls out seems to have problems - the downside of a bonanza; "Lazy Sons" traces a day in the life of two boys who refuse to work in spite of the fulminations of their hard-working parents.
The next section, "Wartime Stories", not surprisingly, contains the most violent and disturbing stories of the book. "Hunger at Bévara" explores the desperation of a village caught between two fronts and the hero Bisma who helped save the village, at least temporarily; "Going To Headquarters" plays with expectations as the tensions between two men, one who might be a spy, and the other who may be his executioner, heighten; "One of the Three Is Still Alive" probably qualifies as the book"s most disturbing story. A man thrown into a deep pit by the enemy discovers that the dead bodies of his comrades broke his fall, he then tries to escape from the pit; "Animal Woods" is both comedic and tragic. A man tries to shoot a looting German soldier but the livestock of his village keeps interfering.
The third section, "Postwar Stories" deals with a desperate world, one with limited resources and where almost anything goes. "Theft in a Pastry Shop" tells the hilarious story of criminals who suddenly find themselves on a gluttonous rampage during a robbery; "Dollars and the Demimondaine" explores a couple"s quest for dollars amongst a crowd of rather lusty American sailors. This section deals with the desperate climate of a postwar country. As people suffer some take a no holds barred approach while others find themselves giving up or asking what"s it worth.
The book"s final, and longest, section, "Stories of Love and Loneliness" is probably the most intriguing. It presages somewhat Calvino"s later book "Mr. Palomar". The style in this section is deeply character driven, and the thoughts and motivations of characters get explained with amazing detail. "The Adventure of a Soldier" follows a soldier"s conquest of a woman seated next to him on a train. He cautiously explores her body to gauge her reaction. Did she pull away? Is she acquiesing? "The Adventure of a Bather" explores how some see nakedness as a humiliation, so much so that they risk death rather then being seen unclothed. "The Adventure of a Photographer" depicts a seemingly non-obsessive man"s all consuming obsession with capturing life through photographs. He"s too engaged to even notice the interest of the beautiful woman acting as his subject; "The Adventure of a Nearsighted Man" shows just how much a pair of glasses can change one"s life. The character can now recognize many things, but other people no longer recognize him. Even the woman he yearns for, and who he"s known for years, doesn"t recognize him with his glasses on.
"Difficult Loves" provides a suitable umbrella title to package these stories under. Many deal with love in its various forms: physical, emotional, spiritual, self, political, material. In nearly all cases the characters in the story have difficulty defining or requiting the love they have for others or things. The book explores the nebulous nature of desire and attraction to others and the inevitable hardships of bridging one"s desires with reality. Throughout the book, Calvino"s writing mesmerizes (even in translation) and pulls the reader in without mercy. The character studies of the final section are incredible in their detail and ambition. It"s amazing how much Calvino can cram into a ten page story. The range of emotions is also incredible. The stories evoke laughter, disgust, pity, shame, and of course love.
If you want a good read or want to study the art of the short story, look no further than this book by Calvino. It won"t disappoint.]]></rev:text>

   <rev:text>Calvino is a genius. I read most of his books and all are differents in style, thematic, lenght, etc; but all are similar in quality, humanity and sensibility.This one is a collection of stories where love is only a component, an important one but not the only (as in real life). Even is not the usual love that it is important here. Reaction to love, moments before love, lonely love are the esential components of these stories. Calvino knows that it is not possible write about love, we can only describe the environment of love, but not LOVE. But when you are able to write about it with the class of Calvino, you do not need anymore.Excellent, excellent and excellent</rev:text>

   <rev:text>Difficult Loves provides a comprehensive look at the art of storytelling, and its ability to expose the subtle emotions and personalities of everyday life.  Calvino is particularly adept at honing in on a definitive moment, or succession of moments in the lives of his characters, and capturing the surprising shifts of relation and consciousness that occur suprisingly and spontaneously.  The last section in the book, Stories of Love and Loneliness, shows Calvino at his most artful, examining the ways that certain types of people experience life and love.  An earlier reviewer pointed out that everyone can find something to connect with in these stories.  This is true in an even deeper sense, namely, that within the narration, sparkling moments of truth are revealed about the workings of the human mind, and they can only be read with a consistently deepening respect for the author and his art.  There is a confessional quality to the work as well, and Calvino hints at his own obsessions and deviancies and shortcomings as a thinker.  This authorial honesty conforms well with the subjects of the stories, all of which are betrayed in a state of almost disconcertingly fallible humanity.  These are the anti-heros, the heros of everyday life and love.  With Difficult Loves, Calvino maps out another essential area of human experience, and does it with a simple beauty that belies the complexity of his grand project.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>I read Difficult Loves a month ago and found that the stories in this book have staying power. Italo Calvino conjures up vivid imagery to accompany magical and unsettling stories. His story telling abilities are such that he reminds readers of long forgotten sensations. We feel the marvel and anxiety of two children who happen upon a property that is both enchanting and disturbing. We experience the elation of a man who is new to glasses and his disappointment upon realizing he found only a temporary reprieve from his same old life. Another story that opens with a leathery old man warning a weary traveler against crossing a mountain pass is one of the most powerfully written tales in the book. Difficult Loves is worth rereading.</rev:text>

   <rev:text><![CDATA[First off, Italo Calvino is my favorite author and Difficult Loves is one of my favorites of his books.  A collection of short stories, as a whole, the book ranks among Calvino"s most imaginative and magical works.

The collection really displays Calvino"s virtuosity as a writer with subjects ranging from war to a solitary woman swimming.  Each is magical in its own special way.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading--it serves as an excellent introduction to one of the most creative minds of 20th-century literature.]]></rev:text>

   <rev:text><![CDATA["Difficult Loves" is a collection of four sets of stories, each set revolving around a particular theme or setting. Calvino"s perspective and style remain constant, however, as he navigates effortlessly between a disparate set of characters and situations. The hallmark of Calvino"s perspective is his ability to take small "slices of life", understand them in great detail, and convert them into fascinating and gripping tales. The attraction to his stories is heightened by the occasional recognition of, and correlation to, the plethora of complex feelings aroused by these small and innocuous happenings. The fact that these feelings are so often buried in our subconscious and never played out recognizably indicate how acute an observer and analyst Calvino really is.

"The Adventure of a Soldier", a part of the last set of stories ("Stories of Love and Loneliness"), is a beautiful example of Calvino"s keen observational faculties. In this story, a man embarks on a complex and courageous mental (and somewhat physical) journey, on the basis of a perceived physical contact with a fellow passenger on a train. Such is the honesty of Calvino"s account of the soldier"s emotions, that the reader can almost palpably feel the various contacts with the co-passenger, while sympathizing, if not empathizing, with the soldier"s state of mind. This story is also a great illustration of the use of dramatic arc as a story-writing tool, especially to connect seemingly disjointed ideas or states.

The one serious drawback of this book is that while it manages to avert becoming platitudinal, it nonetheless becomes increasingly monotonous with the passage of each story. Calvino"s disposition to simplicity and lucidity become his greatest failing as the novelty of his perspective wears off. Thus, overall, this is a book definitely worth reading, but best read in a piecemeal fashion to avoid weariness.]]></rev:text>

   <rev:text>4th Quarter book. 290 pagesDifficult Loves By Italo Calvino is a Novel that contains a variety of stories.  I read the all of the stories. Calvino has unique way in grabbing his readers attention and having them be able to connect to his stories. His usage of words always had me confused and I would find myself having to re-read what I had just read. The one story that I liked the most was "The Adventure of a SOldier." Reading this story reminded me of the BAQ of How do we connect with others? We all sometimes have the need for physical touch in order for us to connect with one another, some kind of intimacy. A lot of times we come to judging eachother by our physical appearance. When Tomagra saw the widow sit next to him, he automatically started to judge how she dressed and made assumptions."She didnt move; he thought: maybe she wants this. But he also thought: Another moment and it will be too late. Or maybe she"s sitting there studying me, preparing to make a scene." (190) I loved how calvino decribed his train of thoughts and how he described his actions. Many of us can relate to Tomagra, moments where you are over thinking your actions and you end up not doing what you are supposed to do, later regretting your decision. I thought it was interesting how the two characters were a soldier and a widow, where love can/is lacked in their lives. So, it made sense that maybe a stranger"s touch is exactly what eachother needed in their lives for the moment. I wondered why the widow didnt say anything to him? why they didnt just talk? Maybe because calvino is trying to say that "actions speak louder than words", that physical touch is stronger than just trying to "touch" a person through verbal actions.Through out the story Tomagra is very tempted to touch this widow but he finds himself trying so hard to come up with ways to get her attention but it doesnt worlk. Finally at the end. He jumps and reaches out to her and touches her and doesnt really do anything about it. I found that really weird.</rev:text>

E assim é que já na primeira história encontramos um soldado indo gozar uma licença durante a Páscoa, e que se vê às voltas com uma viúva, mais velha do que ele, num compartimento do trem em que viajavam; história na qual é possível o riso, é patente (sem trocadilho) a ansiedade de quem quer perpetrar algo ao mesmo tempo cerimonioso e devasso; e assim você vai vendo o sacrifício dele (e o seu, nalguma altura de sua vida) em conseguir, ou não, controlar a mão nas pernas, nos seios da viúva.

São mesmo histórias factíveis, assombrosas, capazes de nos encontrar por aí, a qualquer hora do dia e da noite. Ítalo Calvino é um autor muito bom de se ler, bate na Sociedade, sem ser maçante nem moralista (e olha que estou falando de italiano).]]></rev:text>
