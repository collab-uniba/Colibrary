L"armamentario d"intreccio e di stile è vasto e rutilante (scambio di culle, guerra, amori impossibili/non consumati, matrimoni imposti, scene di varia umanità e storicità indiana per quanto riguarda l"intreccio; realismo magico, io narrante non affidabile, meccanismi scoperti e meta-disquisiti (letteralmente roba del tipo: "Ehi, guardate che quest"oggetto appena citato è un simbolo! E adesso ve lo spiego per bene, o almeno ve lo faccio credere!") sul versante dello stile), tanto che alla fine quello che stupisce è il fatto che il romanzo non provochi irritazione, ma divertito coinvolgimento.</rev:text>

I don"t like his style and I am often thrown by his way of setting the scene, it often takes me a whole page to figure out what is happening then once I figure out what"s going on I have to re-read it with my new found enlightenment.

   <rev:text>The Booker of Booker Prize winners. Best novel in 25 years. Midnight"s Children is Rushdie at his finest. The book is surrealist fiction that deals with the history of India from 1910 to the declaration of the emergency in 1976 through the eyes (and nose) of Saleem Sinai, born on the stroke of Midnight August 15, 1947. Midnight"s Children, like most of Rushdie"s writing, does have political overtones, yet the fog of larger events is never permitted to detract from the more personal experiences of all the multi-faceted characters in the novel.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>Towards the beginning of this book, there is a minor character who is an artist whose paintings have grown huge because he keeps trying to fit life into them. He mourns because he"d wanted to be a miniaturist, but instead  has elephantiasis. Even though the character never recurs, I thought about  him through the huge landscape of this book.Rushdie has the eye for  detail of a miniaturist, but writes in epic sweeps, fitting in countless  lives and actions. If done badly, this would have been nearly impossible to  read, but the execution is brilliant and instead gives the impression of a  huge rich tapestry running by like film.The book is about the Midnight"s  Children (children born in the first hour after the birth of India as a  nation) and their erstwhile leader Saleem Sinai. It traces him (and them)  through childhood, the creation of Pakistan, and beyond. Even though the  events are crucial, to have an understanding of the plot won"t give you any  help with the book.My advice to people attempting Midnight"s Children is  to not worry too much about catching and understanding every detail. Yes,  knowing more about Indian history will make certain things clear (although  it may obscure others), but there"s so much here that it isn"t really  necessary. I already know that this is a book I"m going to re-read, and  that will be the chance to pick up missing pieces.One of the highest of  recommends.</rev:text>

   <rev:reviewer>Avid reader, "English Major"</rev:reviewer>
   <rev:text><![CDATA[This is, in every way, a perfect novel. Both humorous and heartbreaking. I found myself deeply moved and very suprised that I enjoyed this novel as much as I did. I have never been very interested in Indian history, and knew close to nothing about it. But upon reading this novel, I found myself drawn into the rich fictional history of the Aziz family, as well as the equally rich history of India. Rushdie may have ruined reading for me, as every book I read will now have much higher standards! Not for light reading, though. I imagine this is a book that you could read over and over and still find something new each time. This is a tough novel, and it takes a lot of work to truly "get it". The only reason I stuck with it is because I had to for class. But it was very rewarding in the end. The novel reveals itself in layers, with recurring themes and motifs that grow in extremely deep and powerful meanings. The character of Saleem, self-described savior of India, is one of the most memorable characters to have graced the pages of a novel. I have heard some people say that this book is a let down in the end, as though it never comes to a full climax. In answer to that: I felt that was the whole point. Saleems dreams are always dreams, they are never completely realized. The language is beautiful and lyrical, and the plot is highly detailed, as though each sentence was carefully planned. Rushdie may be the ultimate architect of this century when it comes to plot building. As a writer myself, I was both green with envy and speechless with awe over this novel. I have never read anything else by Rushdie, but now I definitly plan to! 

A couple of tips: 
1. There are many different characters, so you may want to make a family tree to keep track.  

2. Pay close attention to Rushdie"s use of color in the novel, particularly green, saffron and blue, as well as numbers. 

3. The narrator, Saleem, breaks away from linear storytelling in a big way. Often, the story jumps around and he gives a lot of foreshadowing. It helps to let go of our western idea of time (i.e. events happening in a timeline) and just let the story unfold. Trust me, once you can let go of your confusion and just let it be, the reading becomes much easier! Also, it"s interesting to consider what he chooses to tell us ahead of time, and what he doesn"t. 

And finally, you will definitly want to brush up on your Indian history! I"m not talking a whole lot, just an Encarta article or something so you know what"s going on. Also, when historical figures are mentioned in the book, you should do a little research and find out more about them. This is especially true for the political figures, such as Indira Ghandi. 

Like I said, this book is A LOT of work, but worth all the effort.]]></rev:text>

   <rev:text>Salman Rushdie"s equot;Midnight"s Childrenequot; appears to be an allegory, spiced with satirical commentary, on the political course of modern India and the in-fighting of its various social and religious factions.  It is an endlessly inventive book with a cheeky sense of humor and wild, exotic imagery, but it does not eschew somber moments.  Rushdie presents this novel as the autobiography of Saleem Sinai, writing from his current residence at a Bombay pickle factory under the critical eye of his frequently interruptive lover/fiance Padma.  Saleem was born on the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947, the precise moment of India"s independence from Great Britain and Pakistan"s formation.  He and one thousand other babies (the Midnight"s Children) born in India throughout the hour each has some supernatural power such as witchcraft, time travel, gender alteration, etc., or otherwise is simply a mutant.  Kind of like the X-Men, except they"re too self-serving to band together and fight crime (and too bad, as there is a lot of narrative potential in this idea).    Saleem routinely hides in a washing-chest in his house to find inner peace away from neighborhood kids who taunt him for his large misshapen nose and other odd facial features.  One day in the chest, he has a strange accident -- he sniffs a pajama cord up his nose, triggering an effect which causes him to hear voices in his head and realize he has telepathic powers.  By telepathy, he establishes communication with the (heretofore unknown to him) other Midnight"s Children, but they prove unwilling to unite.  An operation performed on his nose to stop his severe dripping snot problem clears his nasal passages to reveal an uncanny olfactory ability, enabling him to sniff out emotions and ideas as well as smells.  Saleem also gives an extensive background on his family, beginning with how his maternal grandparents met, up to his pyromaniac-turned-singing-star younger sister.  After his (Muslim) family relocates to Pakistan, almost all of them are killed in the 1965 India-Pakistan war, and in the 1971 war for the independence of Bangladesh, Saleem is conscripted in the Pakistani Army as a human bloodhound.Eventually, Saleem marries Parvati, one of the Midnight"s Children, the witch, who bears a child fathered by his arch enemy Shiva, another of the Midnight"s Children, whose special attribute is his ability to crush people with his overdeveloped knees.  Shiva works as an agent for the government of India, who demand to know the indentities and whereabouts of all the Midnight"s Children, and Saleem is the only one who can tell them...Like E.L. Doctorow"s equot;Ragtime,equot; equot;Midnight"s Childrenequot; blurs the line between historical fact and fiction, weaving fantastic events against a realistic backdrop of a land in turmoil.  Saleem is an extraordinary character, not a hero in the traditional sense but a deformed symbol, a vessel for carrying and displaying the problems and hopes of the people of India.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>equot;Midnight"s Childrenequot; is the first Rushdie book I"ve read, and only the second one by an "exile Indian". I"d heard so much about Rushdie"s literary talent that I went off and bought it.At first I was a little  disappointed, I must say. Rushdie"s prose at the beginning of the book is  clever, intelligent, witty - but it didn"t touch me emotionally. I very  much enjoyed reading it, but I wasn"t too interested in what was going  on.Then, before I"d noticed it, I was hooked. From the moment the  narrator actually became a protagonist, I was involved in the plot. Driven  on by the dozens of hints and foreshadowings, I simply had to know what  would happen, and I began to care about most of the characters.More than  that, Rushdie"s novel is a rich tapestry of politics, magic, metaphor;  there"s so much imagination in this book, but it doesn"t become overladen  as other novels sometimes do. The author juggles his multiple plot lines,  characters and his version of history and India deftly, and for me reading  this novel was a real joy.P.S.: Some readers - and critics - have  complained that Rushdie"s India is not really India. So what? I believe  that equot;Midnight"s Childrenequot; can be enjoyed tremendously as an  imaginative, clever, involving and intelligent novel. Why look for the  "truth" in it? While some readers with a limited knowledge of the country  might take this novel"s geography and history as "the real thing", I don"t  think you should judge literature by its readers.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>Previously, during a scandal with "The Satanic Verses" and Salmon Rushdie"s death sentence, I tried to read his "Shame" but was absolutely disappointed and stopped reading after first 100-150 pages. Now I discern  at least two of my mistakes: I read Rushdie in Russian translation and not  up to the end. "Midnight"s Children" was my second attempt to understand  Rushdie, I was attracted by its Booker and Booker of Bookers. The book  consists of three parts: at first I was tired with author"s derisive style,  then I became interested in the fate of its protagonist, only at the end I  appraised author"s intention and mastery of its realization.An  undeniable strong point of the novel is its excellent language, a wonderful  gallimaufry of indigenous words and such an amazing gamut of English that  can do credit to every unabridged dictionary. Rushdie masterly wields his  skillful pen, a reading of his phrases is a pure pleasure for a literary  gourmet. His style is influenced by the Arabian tales of 1001 nights and -  among modern writers- by famous "magical realism" of Gabriel Garcia  Marquez.The novel is an expression of author"s genuine love to his  native India. Rushdie weaves into the intricate lace of his story all  important events in political, social and spiritual life of India, Pakistan  and Bangladesh since the beginning of the century. But some of his  interpretations are rather disputable (the reviews of readers from Eastern  countries confirm this). In depiction of Indira Gandhi author"s sharp  mockery turns into blind hate, and the Prime Minister of India transforms  into a real devil incarnate, a fiend that sterelizes midnight"s children  depriving them not only of their magical gifts but the hope itself. It is  hard to understand such undisguised selective rage. The third part of the  novel is the best one. Relating about the innumarable sufferings of his  people in Indo-Pakistan conflicts and during formation of Bangladesh,  Salman Rushdie reaches the highest and culminating point of his  story.The novel is full of interesting images such as "the perforated  sheet", "snakes and ladders" and  - first and foremost - "midnight"s  children". All countries, that had passed through social disturbances and  collisions, have known their midnight"s children, a quixotic generation  bestowed with their wonderful gifts but deprived of any possibility of  their realization. Midnight"s children dream that they are inseparably  linked with the future of their beloved country, that they are its part and  parcel with all its misfortunes and joys. They will be overcome by the  persons without illusions but with hard elbows (or knees?) and jaws longing  for power and money. The last chapter of the book gives the joyless and  distressing picture of "new" India after defeat of midnight children (one  more image - equot;Abracadabra"). But the protagonist, ending his story,  leaves one empty pickle jar - a symbol of hope: the children of the  vanquished are alive, they differ from their parents but nevertheless they  ARE their children.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>Midnight"s Children is considered to be Rushdie"s masterpiece; it won the Booker Prize, and then, in 1993, it won the "Booker of Bookers", ie the best book to have won the Booker Prize in the first 25 years of the award.  In addition to this, Rushdie"s reputation is not built upon his literary merits so much as the surrounding controversy of another book, The Satanic Verses, which all but condemned him to years of hiding and constant moving about in an effort to escape fundamentalist Muslim assassination-attempts. The premise for this novel is amazing.  At the stroke of midnight on August 15th, 1947, India achieved independence and became a valid country, free from the shackles of Britain.  One thousand and one children were born in the hour from midnight to 1am, one thousand and one children with magical powers, the potency of which increases the closer the child was born to midnight.  The narrator, Saleem Sinai, was one of two children born on the exact stroke of midnight, and throughout the novel various allusions to yin and yang, good and evil, up and down, et cetera are made between Saleem and Shiva, the other child, but unfortunately nothing really comes from this.  Although mentioned often and with great vehemence on the part of the narrator, Shiva never really came across as a "bad guy", or even someone that should be worried about at all.The story meanders through thirty odd years of life before Saleem"s birth, detailing the lives and idiosyncracies of his parent"s and grandparent"s adventures, which, admittedly, are described with great sweeping motions and tantalizing literary strokes.  Sentences marvel, paragraphs sing with wit or beauty, but...what was the point?  After Saleem is born, events take an incredibly epic turn, as the implications of the children of midnight are revealed, but then, the narrator just sort of forgets about it and rambles on about things that, given the immensely intruiging concept of the children, just doesn"t spark any interest.  The narrator is an interesting writer.  He repeats reiterates recapitulates words in threes, often, and that works.  He used parentheses artfully, and well.  But the narrator foreshadows everything and anything, so that we are always reading about events that will come to pass, soon or otherwise, and in cryptic ways, "He kept himself in the background of our lives, always, except twice...once when he left us; once when he returned to destroy the world by accident".  It is an exceptionally annoying literary technique, serving only to make the reader wish that events would hurry up so that the portentous-sounding episodes will occur, but...even they are marred by fore-shadowing and never really live up to the promises, anyway.The last one hundred and fifty pages drag, seemingly without cohesion, in an effort to combine the plot-threads, to actually make the children a part of the story - and, disappointingly, they really aren"t very predominant - but it doesn"t work.  Then, in a whirlwind twenty pages, everything is tied up neatly, the children are dealt with, and the book ends.  The fantastic premise never really lived up to its promise, and the book suffers.Is Midnight"s Children a failure?  No.  As a story, it is enjoyable, written well, and at times, beautiful.  Certain passages are crafted with amazing skill, and the narrator is a pleasant enough fellow.  But the concept of the midnight"s children should have been ditched - the story would have worked well enough without them because they never really played a part - and the book would have been greater as the spectre of great things to come would not have existed.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>I had this book around the house for years, and, frankly, was afraid to read it.  For some reason, I thought that Salman Rushdie was one of those equot;literaryequot; writers that could only be appreciated by English majors.  I was fascinated by his life of exile and respected him, but could never bring myself to reading him.Then, my son David and my wife Mary both read the book, along with some of David"s friends.  They all raved about it.  Since my family knows my literary tastes better than anyone and were so insistent I would like the book, I had no choice but to give it a try.Once, again, they were right.  The book was a joy to read, and far more accessible, interesting, and funny than I had would have expected.  The narration by Saleem Sinai is priceless.  The story is told mostly chronologically with just enough tangential stream of consciousness ramblings and foretellings to stay interesting.  The premise (the tale of those 1001 children born within the first hour of India"s independence) was a stroke of genius.  The fact that I learned a lot about Indian and Pakistani history was a bonus. The only downside was that the story began to slow down a bit at the end, but since it was essentially the story of the birth of a nation (two, actually), the author couldn"t possibly be expected to keep up the fever pitch he began at.  All in all, it was a great read and a great story and I, for one, will be sure to read more of Mr. Rushdie"s work!!</rev:text>

   <rev:text>Claims of "Masterpiece! Bravo! C"est manifique!" and multitudes of roses gloriously wafting down from the expensive seats in the balcony are justified. This book made Rushdie a star. Rushdie who? Isn"t he the guy who wrote that bizarre quasi-sci-fi novel about some birdguy? Yes, he is. And five years following that dabble (entitled "Grimus" which, to steal Hume"s thunder, "fell deadborn from the press") Rushdie sprung some new fantastic oil reserve of novel writing and produced this utter gem. What a difference a mere five years can make!This is a thick book. It"s a very thick book. Thick with meaning. Thick with stories. Is it about time? Sure. Is it about family? Yup. Is it a political book? Well, sorta. Is it about the vicissitudes of memory and history? Probably, yes, that sounds good. Is it about India? Oh, yup. A lot of India in it, sure sure. Its bulk is impossible to summarize to any degree of fairness. Its bulk in meaning is nearly incomprehensible. Still, it all comes down to the narrator: Saleem Sinai, who, equipped with numerous nicknames and adoptive parents, is pummelled and dragged and drained through India"s independence. Having been born at the very stroke of midnight (or was that his rival, born in the same room, who was the real son of Saleem"s unsuspecting first set of "parents") on the cusp and lip of India"s independence, Saleem later finds himself, and 1001 other children (you guessed it, the "Children of Midnight"), imbued with magical powers beyond belief. The magic of India"s independence from Britain shoots forth wonders. Of course the government under Indira Gandhi isn"t too happy about this, and Saleem finds himself in a very bad sort of pickle later on. These scenes make up some of the more disturbing and violent chapters (and Rushdie was accused by some of being too hard on the Indira régime). Cover your eyes! Plug your ears!This is historical fiction at its best. There"s much to learn about the history of India in these pages of pulp. Some familiar names will pounce out from the ink: Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi (no blood relation to the Mahatma; she was assassinated in 1984, four years after this book was published), Morarji Desai, Lord Viceroy Mountbatten, etc., etc., the names and history they encompass pile up page after page. Saleem and his family are also victims (very unfortunate ones) of the partition of India (into India, Pakistan, and soon after Bangladesh). This event still holds the record for most people moved from one place to another at one time: 14 million people (with about 1 million dead). Then war war war, more war war, and a state of Emergency, war war. Saleem is buffetted through it all, as countless millions were. The novel brings out the complexity and bulk of modern independent India through the voice of Saleem. Make some room in your brain for Rushdie"s "many headed monsters".One of the best scenes is "the perforated sheet" in which a doctor, Saleem"s Grandfather, is only allowed to examine a Muslim woman through a hole in a large sheet. One part at a time, no more, no less. One day he looks through the hole and sees a... Book three is a wild ride which will likely evoke the response "how did Saleem get here?" This book is Saleem"s "rebirth" ending with the "Abracadabra" that changes everything; as book two is about Saleem"s birth and childhood, and book one attempts to sum up the events leading up to Saleem"s birth (the perforated sheet will haunt). Is Saleem an honest narrator, though? Or does he lie through his big teeth (and much bigger and talented nose)? This is one of the many tensions that rips through the novel, and questions and examines biography as well as history. Saleem only admits to lying once.The novel has some debts also. It owes a big one to "Tristram Shandy" written by Lawrence Sterne in the 18th century, in which an autobiographer attempts to write his life and keeps getting mired in digressions. Rushdie takes the best elements of this brilliantly bizarre book and meshes it into his own story of Saleem. Rushdie himself has acknowledged the influence of Sterne. Also, some have called this novel "India"s "Tim Drum"" with its parallel stories of nations with growing pains siphoned through single characters. Regardless of influence, "Midnight"s Children" is an amazing novel rich with meaning, detail, humor, love, tragedy, childhood, family, philosophy, religion, sibling rivarly, and people people people people people people burgeoning out through the lines of text like on a crowded Mumbai street. There are, in short, people everywhere.This book is worth the effort. It may take a little more effort than expected. It"s huge, it"s complex, it"s part history part fantasy. What it attempts to do, in a very human way, is posit meaning to events and lives and their very multifarious interpretations. It can all be found in cleverly labeled pickle jars. C"est manifique!</rev:text>

   <rev:text><![CDATA[Saleem Sinai, the narrator, was born when the clock struck twelve on the day when India became free of Britain at last (1947).  Through some strange effect of physics, each of the children born at that time has something wrong with him-or right, some special spooky power they cannot figure out.  Some have extra special sensitivity, others super strength.  Some of the superpowers are funny, some quite poignant.  Like the X Men, Midnight"s Children are (mostly) ashamed of their special gifts; and this becomes a metaphor for the admixture of Hindu and Muslim that made up India until the partition a year or so later and the birth of Pakistan.  And still the races and religions cavort in an eternal spectacle of high and low.  Saleem"s own power is the ability to experience smells with more punch than ordinary citizens, and you can imagine in the pungent provinces of India he visits this is as much a curse as a blessing.

The two babies, switched at birth, become each other"s opposite number.  A Hindu boy, raised as a Muslim; a Muslim, raised Hindu.  As Shakespeare said, in ALL"S WELL THAT ENDS WELL:  "For I the ballad will repeat/ Which men full true shall find:/ Your marriage comes by destiny,/ Your cuckoo sings by kind."  As the servant Padma listens to this modern Scheherezade, the relations of master and servant also dissolve from within, a dark allegory of the postcolonial nexus of modern writing.  Rushdie seems to be hinting that we"re none of us where we"re meant to be, and that at this late date there"s not much we can do but lump it.

After 25 years MIDNIGHT"S CHILDREN continues to sell happy numbers of copies for its author, the controversial and limelight-dwelling Salman Rushdie.  He lives comfortably off the many editions his masterpiece has gone through.  Every now and then you hear an imaginative screenwriter announce that he"s "conquered" MIDNIGHT"S CHILDREN, but in truth the pleasure of the book is very much in its intratextual details, and I can"t imagine a successful movie version, though I said the same about MYSTERIOUS SKIN and look how wrong I was there.]]></rev:text>

   <rev:text><![CDATA["...our physical alienation from India almost inevitably means that we will not be capable of reclaiming precisely the thing that was lost; that we will, in short, create fictions, not actual cities or villages, but invisible ones, imaginary homelands, Indias of the mind." -Salman Rushdie

Rushdie uses his characters to help develop these imaginary homelands. In turn they represent different aspects of India and the overarching ideas of the time. Saleem"s memory and subsequent loss of it during the Indo-Pakistani war (where Bangladesh declares independence from Pakistan) is an example of the confusion of the social memory at that time. An example of this representation of Saleem as the memory of India, or that he represents India is the geography lesson where Zagallo says to the class about Saleem, "In the face of these ugly ape you don"t see the whole map of India?"(231) They use his nose to represent the Deccan peninsula; the `stains" represent Pakistan, "a stain of the face of India" (232). So Saleem"s face represents the lands over which the wars are fought throughout the book. "In any war, the field of battle suffers worse devastation than either army. This is natural" (43), says Aziz in the beginning of the book, foreshadowing the suffering of his own grandson. 

Saleem seems to understand his own ostracism from his family even before he becomes aware that he is literally not of their blood. He resists falling into the same cracks as his grandfather early in the narration:
	
Family history, of course, has its proper dietary laws. One is supposed to swallow and	digest only the permitted parts of it, the halal portions of the past, drained of their	redness, their blood. Unfortunately, this makes stories less juicy; so I am about to become the first and only member of my family to flout laws of halal. (59)

One of the most memorable quotes of the novel:

...maybe there is something unnatural about me, some fundamental lack of emotional response; but my thoughts have always aspired to higher things. Hence my resilience. Hit me: I bounce back (But no resistance is of any use against the cracks.) (396-397)

Here he is resisting his family"s ways, and the ways of his family"s culture with the reference to his grandfather"s admission of religion. Saleem addresses the cracks again at the end of the novel after his grandfather has died. He gives himself a piece of advice about his grandfather"s ways on page 187 when he quotes "What can"t be cured must be endured." He is referring to the first page of the novel, when he introduces his grandfather:

...he resolved never again to kiss any earth for any god or man. This decision, however, made a hole in him, a vacancy in a vital inner chamber, leaving him vulnerable to women and history. (10)

Aziz becomes the splitting India figuratively. Aziz"s education comes from Tai, early in the Novel, "From Tai, Aadam learned the secrets of the lake" (17). The lake represents older more violent ways, as Tai is known for his murder and drowning of European women who come to ride in his boat. Tai"s resistance is more of a rebellion to Colonialism, if violent at that. Aziz absorbs these older traditions but maintains a newer generational understanding of his culture that he discusses in his marriage to Naseem. Before he marries her he comes to a symbolic realization about her (and consequently India):

So gradually Doctor Aziz came to have a picture of Naseem in his mind, a badly fitting collage of her severally-inspected parts. This phantasm of a partitioned woman began to haunt him, and not only in his dreams. Glued together by his imagination she accompanied him on all his rounds, she moved into the front room of his mind, so that waking and sleeping he could feel in his fingertips the softness of her ticklish skin or the perfect tiny wrists or the beauty of her ankles; he could smell her scent of lavender and	chambeli; he could hear her voice and her helpless laughter of a little girl; but she was	headless, because he had never seen her face. (25)

When Aziz marries her, he finds that the sex is disappointing. He says to her, "Forget about being a good Kashmiri girl. Start thinking about being a modern Indian woman" (34). He resists from saying for her to be a modern `British" woman, even though India has not become independent yet, but refers to their own culture. Instead of taking his advice, Naseem does her own resisting that is seen in the rest of their marriage as a result. 

Naseem is called assiduous throughout the novel (especially on 67), a word that means, "Constant in application or effort; working diligently at a task; persevering; industrious; attentive: an assiduous student."  She resists the sexual education of her marriage for tradition, and claims power from it:

	It is a sign of power of this custom that even when her husband was afflicted by constipation, she never once permitted him to choose his food, and listened to no requests or words of advice. A fortress may not move. Not even when its dependants" movements become irregular. (41)

The battle between Aziz"s modernisms and Naseem"s traditional ways culminates in a starvation war. Aziz sends about the children"s religious instructor and Naseem refuses to cook for him anymore in rebellion. Aziz stubbornly refuses to eat anything else and wastes away. When Aziz becomes deathly thin, Alia and Naseem devise a plan and Naseem pretends to fall ill. Alia feeds both of them until everything is better and they have both reclaimed their pride. This domestic version of the impact of modern colonialism, the resistance and the reclamation mirrors exactly what was going on in many families and India at the time. It is hard to encapsulate the entire reality, as Rushdie has Saleem suddenly admit, "Is this an Indian disease, this urge to encapsulate the whole reality? Worse: am I infected, too?" (75). Saleem revisits his grandfather who has just found religion at age sixty-eight and finds Aziz:

I saw the cracks in his eyes - a delicate tracery of colourless lines against the blue; I saw	a network of fissures spreading beneath his leathery skin.  (275)

(Saleem recognizes these cracks as death.) Aziz tells his family of his religious experience meeting God,

...although the details of the particular deity he had seen grew blurred in his mind, leaving behind only a passionate, drooling desire for revenge (which is also common to us both)...he would refuse to go to Pakistan (as Reverend Mother planned). (276-277)

Aziz dies on Christmas Day, 1963. The allusions to muscular Christianity and Colonialism are not lost. Even when presented with this force in his old age, Aziz responds with resistance. Aziz has always represented the secular generation in the novel. When he gets rid of the religious tutor in the beginning of the novel he says to his wife, "He was teaching them to hate, wife. He tells them to hate Hindus and Buddhists and Jains and Sikhs..." (42-43). Rushdie himself admits that he is secular: 

I am a member of that generation of Indians who were sold the secular ideal. One of the things I liked, and still like, about India is that is based on a non-sectarian philosophy. I was not raised in a narrowly Muslim environment; I do not consider Hindu culture to be either alien from me or more important than the Islamic heritage. I believe this has something to do with the nature of Bombay, a metropolis in which the multiplicity of commingled faiths and cultures curiously creates a remarkably secular ambience. Saleem Sinai makes use, eclectically, of whatever elements from whatever sources he chooses. It may have been easier for his author to do this from outside modern India than inside it. (431)

Even with the resistance of his own religion, Aziz succumbs to reclaim one before he dies. His openness to all religions shows that the idea of secularism transcends the nation of India, and Pakistan and Bangladesh and aspires to familiarize itself to the world. The religious, secular and resistant characters are Rushdie"s way to signal that his characters transcend narrowly defined cultures.
 
All of the characters in the novel, while transcending narrowly defined cultures are trying to come to and understanding about colonialism, resistance and reclamation. Rushdie"s perception of the `big picture symbolism" (which he reveals through his characters) is coming to an understanding about something from experience, and by doing so, coming to a consciousness of both personal and collective identity. Rushdie was able to see "the big picture" from his deracination from India as he writes the novel in England. The secular character in the novel, Saleem"s grandfather Aadam Aziz, introduces this generation of secular thinkers. This school of thought then existed before the Independence of India, and the birth of Saleem. Secularism is one example of an idea that transcends the nation of India, and Pakistan and Bangladesh. This seems to be Rushdie"s overarching objective: to leave us all with an understanding about something, and by doing so coming to a consciousness of both personal and collective identity. We must remember the events the characters and the history of this story for: 

"It may be argued that the past is a country from which we have all emigrated, That its loss is part of our common humanity." -Salman Rushdie]]></rev:text>

   <rev:text>My feelings for Midnight’s Children ebbed and flowed throughout my reading much as the tide. Akin to the piece of modern art adorning the wall of a local gallery, on first sight there is dislike and confusion, I cannot connect with the artist. What are they saying, what language are they speaking.Over time I move closer, I start to see the individual brush strokes that make the whole. I gain appreciation for each artistic stroke; in fact I’ve seen none better. No artist I’ve seen has such mastery of their palette subtly placed in each stroke. I step forward, the closer my nose to canvas, I become enthralled. I am part of the canvas; it’s become part of me. I feel it, I smell it, I visualise it, it is India.Stepping back I again view the whole, the tide ebbs once more. I’m left with those impressions of close examination; the humour, the message beneath the message, the masterful stroke construction, the evocative taste of the underlying canvas and my introduction to magical realism.As I walk away though, there is no need to give it that lover’s admiring over the shoulder glance.

   <rev:text>For the first 250 pages or so, I was loving this book - so colourful, such strong characters, such pace, so evocative of India (even though I"ve never been)! But then, I thought it sort of lost steam - and as I lost interest in the story, I started to notice that Rushdie"s prose is irritating. And once I"d noticed, it got more and more annoying. He"s constantly, on every other page, doing a quick recap of what"s already happened and a foreshadow of what"s to come - as though he thinks you"ve got a woeful attention span and must have forgotten what you"ve only just read. And in constantly pointing out all the previous events that this new event mirrors, he saps much of the fun out of reading. For instance, you"re denied the pleasure of noticing that women changing their names is a motif in the book, because Rushdie comes crashing in shouting OH LOOK, SHE"S CHANGED HER NAME JUST LIKE THESE THREE OTHERS BEFORE. And there"s lots of interesting symbolism, but instead of leaving it to be found, he all but clubs you over the head with it. SO for the last 400 pages of this book, I was too frustrated to really enjoy myself. Booker of Bookers? Really? Not in my book, I"m afraid.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>Salman Rushdie’s Booker Prize winning novel Midnight’s Children is the story of a nation narrated by Saleem Sinai who embodies the history of India by being born at the exact moment of India’s independence (August 15, 1947). Other children, also born between midnight and one o’clock on this day, discover they are able to telepathically communicate with each other.In fact, all over the new India, the dream we all shared, children were being born who were only partially the offspring of their parents - the children of midnight were also the children of the time: fathered, you understand, by history. It can happen. Especially in a country which is itself a sort of dream. - from Midnight’s Children, page 132 -The novel is allegorical, narrated in the first person, and spans more than sixty years from before Saleem is born until he is thirty years old. Saleem’s voice is arrogant, satirical and tangential.Family history, of course, has its proper dietary laws. One is supposed to swallow and digest only the permitted parts of it, the halal portions of the past, drained of their redness, their blood. Unfortunately this makes the stories less juicy; so I am about to become the first and only member of my family to flout the laws of halal. Letting no blood escape from the body of the tale, I arrive at the unspeakable part; and, undaunted press on. - from Midnight’s Children, page 62 -Although difficult to follow at times, Rushdie’s sense of humor was one of the aspects of the novel I enjoyed.Poor Padma. Things are getting her goat. Perhaps even her name: understandably enough, since her mother told her, when she was small, that she had been named after the lotus goddess, whose most common appellation amojngst village folk is “The One Who Possesses Dung.” - from Midnight’s Children, page 20 -Despite these light moments, Midnight’s Children is not a light read. I really struggled to finish this book - and my feelings about it are mixed. Rushdie’s prose is full of symbolism, analogies, magical realism and the complex history of India. The book has multiple themes (the individual vs. the masses and destruction vs. creation to name two). It is also full of numerous characters - some minor, some major and everything in between. I often found myself scratching my head trying to understand it all.Important to concentrate on good hard facts. But which facts? One week before my eighteenth birthday, on August 8th, did Pakistani troops in civilian clothing cross the cease-fire line in Kashmir and infiltrate the Indian sector, or did they not? In Delhi, Prime Minister Shastri announced “massive infiltration…to subvert the state”; but here is Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister, with his riposte: “We categorically deny any involvement in the rising against tyranny by the indigenous people of Kashmir.” - from Midnight’s Children, page 387 -Rushdie is obviously brilliant. He knows how to tell a story. And yet I did not really enjoy reading this book and there are very few people to whom I could recommend it. If you are a person with some understanding of Indian culture and history and who loves symbolic stories filled with elements of magical realism, you might want to give Midnight’s Children a try. I am told it is one of his more accessible novels. If that is true, I don’t think I’ll be reading any more Rushdie in the near future.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>Indian literature isn"t for me and it"s not the fact they use way too many words to express their thoughts, I just find it dull and out of magic - okay, I haven"t given Indian literature so many chances and I"m not saying I won"t, but it"s definately not going to be Rushdie.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>After recently finishing Mistry"s "A Fine Balance" I planned to give myself a break from Indian lit for a while, but finding myself without a book on the other side of the country, the only books in the shop that called out to me were Indian - so I bought three!Midnight"s children is regarded as a classic, and deservingly so. I cannot help but contrast it with "A Fine Balance" which I so recently read. Both are brilliantly written, inspiring books that intricately intertwine with India"s tumultuous history. Yet they are as different as night and day. Midnight"s children, although similarly passing through some quite dark hours of history, does not have the deflating, depression quality that the other book has. If anything Rushdie"s writing shows symptoms of the "disease of optimism" that his characters and his country so often succumb to in the novel. Despite the flawed narrator Saleem"s neverending series of mishaps and his sense of inevitable doom, I couldn"t help but feeling upbeat throughout this novel.Part of what makes this book so interesting is that it combines history with fantasy. Not just in the usual sense of historical fiction, but in a more magical, mystical sense. I won"t go into detail but this makes this book a delight to read. The first person narration is quirky, racing forwards and backwards and admittedly suffering from errors of memory and chronology but never too off-beat so as to get confusing (or rarely so).Yet another book I highly recommend. Look forward to reading more of Salman Rusdhie"s work in the future.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>The protagonist and narrator of Midnight"s Children, Saleem Sinai, is the bastard child of a British colonialist father and a poor Indian mother.  He is switched at birth with another child and raised by well-off Indian Muslim parents in Bombay (with some short stays also in Karachi and elsewhere).  After reading this book, I think Rushdie might himself be the secret offspring of James Joyce and Samuel Beckett, raised by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.  He uses the kaleidoscopic jumble of stylistic devices found in Ulysses, the self-reflective meditations on the art of novel-writing that structure Malone"s Dead, and the magical realism of One Hundred Years of Solitude (though with more pop-culture sensibility and less mytho-poetic feeling than Marquez brings to bear; I suppose Bollywood movies would be his true adoptive cultural parent).  Rushdie"s own bastard offspring would have to be Paul Beattie of White Boy Shuffle, who transports Rushdie"s fantastically diverse--and superficially drawn--range of characters to inner-city Los Angeles (and, Rushdie-like, endows some of them with magical powers).The book was an enjoyable read, especially when I could devote some time to it and immerse myself in its fictional world.  Saleem is an engaging narrator, and the device Rushdie uses of writing the book as if Saleem is writing it--as his partner, Padma, reads the manuscript over his shoulder--creates interesting effects.  Sometimes I wish Rushdie"s characters were more well-rounded and that he would concentrate on depth of depiction rather than continuous invention of characters.  But it seems that he"s not aiming for a Victorian-style exploration of egos but rather a depiction of a country"s history.  Read for this subject, the novel is very rewarding.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>I have to start this review by admitting I love Salman Rushdie’s work. I fell in love when I read Shalimar the Clown back in July of 08. The Satanic Verses which I read next remains one of my all time favorite books. Haron and other Sea Stories was next on my list and once again Rushdie wooed me with his words. When I finished Haron I had to make a hard decision; what of Rushdie’s do I read next?As I researched which of his titles I wanted to tackle next his book Midnight’s Children won the Man Booker of all Booker prizes http://www.themanbookerprize.com/news... This I had to read so I did. It took me a month, but it was well worth the time.Midnight’s Children is a very rich (often too rich) metaphor on the birth of India as a nation. Saying the tale centers on one particular child, Saleem Sinai, who is born at the stroke of midnight of India’s independence, would be doing Rushdie injustice. Every character in this book could easily be the protagonist. This is the magic and genus of Rushdie; all his characters’ are fully developed and have amazing back stories. My favorite character was Aadam Aziz, Saleem’s grandfather. Rushdie starts the tale, as he often does, in Kashmir, (Kashmir seems to be a magic place for Rushdie) with Aziz coming home with a medical degree. Aziz is called upon to look at a local sick girl who is veiled behind a curtain. Aziz can only view her ailing body part but over time he views her body bit by bit and as he does he falls in love. This is a lovely metaphor showing the physical aspect of how we tend to fall in love; by seeing in the other person that which we want to see and ignore the rest.Eventually they marry and move to Bombay where most of the tale takes place. The reader is introduced to Saleem’s mother, father, aunts ,and uncles before Saleem is born so that by the time he is the reader is emotionally involved in his family and their secretes.As India is born so too is Saleem, who along with all the other midnight children, is born with a gift or curse depending on how one looks at it. Saleem is born with the gift of mind reading. This leads Saleem to learn many of his family’s secretes and discover the other midnight children. These children deserve a book of their own, I am still thinking of many of them , wondering what happened to them.The tale weaves in and out of real events both past and present. Saleem is put in the middle of many political events and causes quite a bit too! This is the one caution I would pass on to anyone thinking of reading this book; if the only think you know about India is where to find it on a globe, this book may not be for you. Rushdie assumes the reader knows the events and people he is writing about. I am very versed in India history but even I had to look up a few names to better understand what Rushdie was talking about.Rushdie can write like no other. Every page is full of prose, metaphors, and stories. Rushdie is the only writer I can think of who can span two life times in just a couple of pages, or write as if each word was a poem unto itself. Reading him can be exhausting at times because of this, but if you stick with him he will whisper magical verses to you and tell you a story that will stay with you for a long, long time.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>I think that this novel may very well be the best piece of contemporary literature that I have EVER read. In fact, it ranks in the top ten books from ANY time period. Rushdie"s ingenious plays on words and unbelievable prowess and originality in storytelling is unrivalled in this century. The character of Saleem is one of the most human characters in all of literature, and his imperfect, or errata, narration only helps the reader see just how human he is. I have never read a novel in which the narrator explicitly says that what he is saying may be mistaken or even completely made up, because memory is in no way a reliable source for facts and historical happenings. In hindsight, we look back on a world that in many ways has been made up in our heads, that we have made better (or worse) without even realizing that we have added our own spin on reality. This book even caused me to realize things about myself, and my reality, and to understand the absolute fallability of memory and, consequentially, the absolute objectivity of history. There is no one history, but instead as many histories as there are people in the world. As someone who hopes to one day publish their own work, I can only hope to learn from Rushdie"s genius, and if I am ever compared to him in any way, I couldn"t be anything but gratified.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>Great book, but I think the Rushdie fairy kept adding pages to it when I was asleep.  The narrator talks on and on so much that you can read for an hour and still feel like you"ve made no progress.   The long-winded ramblings definitely get old, and the book certainly could have been shorter, but there"s so much great writing in such great form that it is a complaint I find easy to dismiss.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>When I should have been doing other work (or taking a nap) the other day, I sat down and finished the last two chapters of Salman Rushdie"s Midnight"s Children, the second book in my process of reading every Rushdie novel to date. The reason this review is simple is that I have absolutely no criticism of this book whatsoever. This is quite possibly one of the best and most ingeniously crafted pieces of literature I have ever had the incredible pleasure of reading. The intricacies of the expansive plot are mind-blowing, and the foreshadowing and self-reference that permeates the narrative lend it the verissimilitude to make Saleem Sinai, the protagonist and narrator, seem to be a real, live person that lived his life inseparably bonded to the fate of India as a result of his birth at midnight on August 15, 1947— the exact moment India became independent. If I needed any reaffirming of my goal to read every Rushdie novel after finishing Shalimar the Clown, this is it. I"m almost tempted to say that if someone were to read only one English-language 20th century novel, this would be it, but I don"t think I"ve read enough to say that definitively. The novel"s accolades, however, including the Booker Prize and twice the Best of the Booker, back me up in confirming Midnight"s Children"s place on the shortlist for that distinction. There"s so much to experience in this book— so many flavors, so many spices— that it just may become the first novel I ever read a second time from cover to cover. There just aren"t enough words to say how much I truly enjoyed this book and how I am humbled by Rushdie"s ability as an author. How blessed we are to have a mind like his in our world.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>I was incredibly frustrated with this novel in the first fifty to one hundred pages. For all the energy and verve of Rushdie"s writing, he had a number of literary tics that irritated me, and the protagonist"s diversions felt overblown and tedious. After that, it began to grow on memdash;there is much to admire in how Rushdie so carefully constructed the thematic resonances throughout the work, and I gradually realised that I had to treat Midnight"s Children as a history not of Saleem, the protagonist, but of India itself. I"m pretty sure I would have an even greater appreciation of those central portions of the book if I did not, to my shame, know very little of contemporary Indian history, but those elements I did pick up on, I enjoyed greatly. Rushdie deals well with all the complexity and promise and failures of modern India, though I did feel at times that he scope to be... kinder, I suppose, to his country than he was. I began to lose patience, and with Saleem, with the novel a little once more towards the endmdash;the ending is telegraphed for a long, long time, but I felt that Rushdie was obstinately slow about getting there. I"m not sorry that I read Midnight"s Children, but I think Rushdie"s prose is something of an acquired taste, and to be consumed in moderationmdash;I"m not sure that I"ll read another of his.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>Try as I might, I could not bring myself to like this book.  Twice I put it down and walked away, the second time writing and retracting what was, as I thought at the time, a prematurely vitriolic review.I figured perhaps I was missing the point; Midnight"s Children would eventually deliver the goods.  After all, amongst the needless drudgery there were sporadic moments of poetic clarity in which Rushdie imparts some truly beautiful storytelling. Third time lucky perhaps things would fall into place?Unfortunately not.  My dislike spiralled with each eye-rollingly pointless chapter. Constantly infuriated by the overblown prose, inconsequential characters and hateful, self-obsessed protagonist, I struggled my way through to the end and it has left me feeling hollow.What it did achieve was an overbearing atmosphere of disappointment.  Every character is lazily introduced in a matter of lines, each new and potentially interesting sub-plot is squanderously concluded in a matter of pages.  Even the children at the heart of the book"s title are under-utilised and essentially pointless.Midnight"s Children promised much but as far as I"m concerned, did not deliver.  While I can"t say I hated it, I am at best indifferent.If you want poignant, relevant Indian fiction then read A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry, a book that, in my opinion, effortlessly achieves everything this novel does not.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>Saleem is one of 1,000 children born at midnight on the day of the "birth of India" -- the day it became a nation free from British rule. These children have all acquired some sort of power or talent and Saleem, among other skills, has the ability to connect them all telepathically. The story follows Saleem as he grows up in the new India and comes in and out of contact with these other children and navigates the world that is changing all around him. The adult Saleem is the narrator and he admits that the story is his perhaps deluded interpretation of his own childhood but you want to believe that such a world of fantasy could exist in a modern setting.http://webereading.com/2008/07/i-was-...</rev:text>

   <rev:text>What a purely maddening book - the story is compelling, great to read, a page-turner, until you think too much about it - the writing style is irritating, pretentious - and yet the story and the style of writing are one and the same and cannot be separated. Lots of India in it for those who want to take side trips out of the novel into history (from imagined history). Not a work that lacks ambition!</rev:text>

   <rev:text>Not a quick and simple read, but a very enriching experience. Fantastic knowledge sharing of Indian history and culture, great characters (although i must admit keeping up with so many characters sometimes got the better of me for short amounts of time), an admirable and inspiring author, covering some very serious life aspects with intelligent lightness.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>This book won the Booker of Bookers, so when I saw it sitting on the shelf, it said, “I must be good, take me home!”  After all, I’ve adored some other Booker winners.Not this one.Saleem Sinai is born at the stroke of midnight, August 15th, 1947, at the same moment that India becomes an independent nation.  He knows that he must be special - he even receives a letter from the Prime Minister for such a fortuitious birth time.  This book isn’t just about him, though, it is about several generations of his family and the history of his country, all of which makes it into a lengthy literary saga.I didn’t like Saleem.  He drove me crazy with his dodging of topics and endless diversions.  I wasn’t interested in his relationship with Padma and I got completely fed up with his self-important attitude.  I understand that his condition is reflected by India throughout the novel, but that didn’t mean I enjoyed reading about it just because it had literary value. His connection with the other midnight children was interesting, but once again his arrogance ruined it. He’s an unreliable narrator to an extent, but not in the way that I like, if that makes any sense at all.  He’s just trying to make himself sound good.  Maybe because he is, apparently, not very attractive.India, as a country, was by far the most compelling character throughout the book.  I loved reading about the different regions, about Bombay and Delhi, about how rapidly India was changing.  I’d certainly recommend this book for insight into the culture and that is easily the best part of it.  I wouldn’t mind seeing the Kashmir region for myself, now, after reading about it so many times.So, in the end?  I think Midnight’s Children was too literary for me.  I can tell that I’d get more enjoyment out of it if I went through in a class and then had to write a paper on it to pick it apart.  As I was going through, I actually picked out paper topics that would illuminate the subject matter better.  I’m not quite crazy enough to go out and write a paper just now, though.  If I ever have fewer TBRs waiting for me, I might pick it up again and see if I can catch some of the threads that I missed this time, but I don’t anticipate that happening for a long time. http://chikune.com/blog/?p=218</rev:text>

   <rev:text>Magic realism? Well, I dunno. More like alchemical realism, where each situation is transient, each environment has an element introduced into it that forces a chemical - maybe a magical - change. Or mythic realism, because I went through kind of thinking Rushdie was burying the lede here, taking a simple, affecting, brave new story about a brother and a sister, and a conference of children with the most fantastic of mutant powers and boundless unity - the myth that India needs - and drowning it in all this family memoir and sounds-and-smells colour and historical minutiae and nonsense. Because if Ireland is a day about town, Ancient Greece is the Olympics, America is a sports movie, China is a heavenly bureaucracy and Japan is a company, what is India but a legion of superheroes? But then it"s like, don"t be such a callow enthusiast, McCarvill. Recall VS Naipaul and his spit spit spittery about India and her prospects. She"s not a legion of superheroes - not a DC team - she"s a Marvel team, a ragbag collection of brilliant misfits born under a bad sign (Midnight"s Children because they were born at midnight on the day of Indian independence), lurching from Days of Future Past to Civil War to disaster to renewal. This is a book about how each generation dies unfulfilled, and how that"s ultimately no big deal because the more powerful cliche is "hope springs eternal." And in fecund India, there is no shortage of new generations of special children waiting to be born - as many children as gods and as many gods as children - and the river flows on and so we get back to Marquez and magic realism in a way. This is a great book.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>I decided to read Midnight"s Children because I had heard wonderful things about Salman Rushdie"s writing, and particularly about this book.  I was not disappointed.  It was a beautiful read through and through, with an expansive plot and incredible imagery.  The repetition of symbols and concepts was cleverly done and the narrative tone was remarkable.  Perhaps because of the richness of the book, it took me longer than usual to get through it, even though I was enjoying every moment of reading it.  I highly recommend it for anyone interested in beautiful writing, stories about family, or for those who want an interesting view on the Indian subcontinent.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>This being the most acclaimed of Rushdies books, I was expecting to enjoy it, that and for the reason that I"d enjoyed the last six of his books that I"ve read. 	I found this book to have the most in common with the Moor"s Last Sigh,out of the other books from this author, there is quite a considerable focus on the fortunes of the protagonist"s family, over a number of generations, and it is predominantly set in India. I would say it ranks as my joint second favourite book of his, along with the previously mentioned title. I don"t know quite what I was expecting more of, but this book somehow failed to quite live up to what I was anticipating, just. It recently was voted the best of the booker prize winners in the last 40 years, or something like that, but for me it wasn"t as good a read as the Satanic Verses, though I have read none of the other winners, so I can"t compare it to them. 	It is written well, and the plot is good, but it didn"t stir my imagination in quite the same way. It is in a different league to some of his other books, but I would not rate it even as my best read of the year so far, (Lempriere"s Dictionary). Despite all this, I would reccomend it heartily, and especially to anyone who has not yet read any of Rushdie, or has not made their mind up about him yet.	What the book has going for it is the ambitious plot, the creative way that it is written, and the excellent imagination that has gone into it. On all three of these things though, it is bested by the Satanic Verses in my opinion, marginally, except the plot, where it is far outshone. Here, I found the characters to be too much like childish stereotypes, and this stopped it from being ever so convincing, he does not make this mistake in his later books, so don"t let this put you off reading his later works.	You should enjoy this book if you have an interest in India, which comes across to me as a fascinating place, with an intersting culture. I would also reccomend this book to those who like something out of the ordinary.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>This book nearly ruined me for all other books. Not from joy. Not from marvel. But sheer exhaustion. Its scope is so immense and foreign (to me, an ingoramus of Indian mid-century politics), its symbolism so constant and deep that instead of the thrill of discovery I turned furtive and avoided its clutches. I could only pound through a dozen pages in a sitting. Every sentence so dripping with meaning, every setting and object multi-dimensionally important. I have nothing bad to say about this book--it is a seminal masterwork--but did I enjoy it? Sadly, no.Rushdie has done this to me before. Tempted me with such completeness of vision, led me into a labyrinthine tome that then wracked me for a fortnight. It happened in 2001 with "The Ground Beneath her Feet." I thought this would be different. And now, as then, I feel that I am the failure. Why did the genius of this book beat me down? Perhaps I feel I gave it short shrift, even though it took me more than two weeks to read--a veritable lifetime in my normal reading pace. This book deserves a seminar series, a dissertation, not just a dilletante"s shallow perusal. I hammered on my brain trying to put all of the symoblic pieces together, but I know, know, know I have fallen far, far short.The book"s early settings in mountainous Kashmir were evocative and easy-reading enough to lull me into thinking I could deal with the rest of the book. But then: enter the fracas of Bombay, and then politics: my academic Achilles heel (OK, along with biz/economics) and one of the few things in the world that bores me to seizures. In all, reading this book seemed like an artistic duty. An offering up to the shrine of Rushdie"s import and brilliance, but one of guilt, not joy.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>Saleem Sinai was born at midnight on August 15, 1947, just as India attained independence.  At the age of 10, he becomes aware that all children born in the historic first hour of independence are endowed with special gifts:  It was as though -- if you will permit me one moment of fancy in what will otherwise be, I promise, the most sober account I can manage -- as though history, arriving at a point of the highest significance and promise, had chosen to sow, in that instant, the seeds of a future which would genuinely differ from anything the world had seen up to that time. (p. 234)  Saleem"s story plays out in accordance with a prophesy delivered to his mother shortly before his birth.  His story is a metaphor for India.  And, over the course of this book, the journeys and fates of Midnight"s Children parallel India"s growing pains.I did not expect to like this book as much as I did.  At first, I found Rushdie"s prose a bit wordy, and I"m not a big fan of magical realism.  But once the secret of Midnight"s Chidren was revealed, I was hooked and found this book hard to put down.  I was also intrigued because Rushdie himself was born in 1947; to what extent did political and economic events shape him?  How much of his story is embodied in Midnight"s Children?  This book is on the shortlist for this year"s "Best of Booker" award, having already been recognized as the "Booker of Bookers" on the 25th anniversary of the prize.  It"s a a noteworthy book and one I"m glad to say I"ve read.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>I was very disappointed with this book, which I finished yesterday, given its literary reputation and some of the comments here.Like others, I found parts of the book a real slog but persevered with it in the expectation of a great climax but, for me at least, it did not deliver.I grew to dislike the narrator, Saleem, intensely. To me, he seemed self-centred, solipsistic and arrogantly self-pitying. If he is meant to reflect his nation, then Rushdie was being pretty damning. He is very intrusive, which was annoying too. Many of the other characters sounded fascinating, but Saleem did not flesh them out enough for my liking.As for the language, I"m someone who generally prefers his prose lean and mean, but I can cope with florid if it is done well. Large parts of it were overwritten, but there were sequences in this book where there was undeniably great writing - the last chapter of Part One, leading up to independence and Saleem"s birth, was outstanding, I thought.However, to my mind, Garcia Marquez, to whom Rushdie owes an enormous debt, does this sort of thing considerably better, with a much lighter and subtler touch. If this is India finding its voice, as one of the puffs says on the back of my copy, then it is a voice from Bogota, not Bombay.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>I am baffled that, in the context of my favorite books and genres, I never took up this novel before now. But better late than never, right?In short, the story of Midnight’s Children is the story of Saleem Sinai. Born at the moment that India emerged as an independent nation, and doomed to splinter into as many pieces as there are Indian citizens, Saleem’s life story is filled with both remarkable midnight-given gifts and moments of all-too-human tragedy.I adore magical realism, and Midnight’s Children is certainly one of the finest examples of the genre. Indeed, a new nation’s growing pains as it splits from its colonizer, and its struggle to incorporate its multi-faceted past with its vision of a modern future, might very well be the definitive magical-realist setting. And in Saleem, Rushdie has brilliantly crafted the perfect hero-cum-storyteller, a character who is both the setting incarnate (yet remains a compelling and sympathetic figure in his own right).For this reason, Saleem’s story is impossible to understand separately from India’s story. The course of Saleem’s life is paced and charted by that of India (and the relationship often works in the converse); this connection underlies two major themes of the novel: interconnectedness and fragmentation. Saleem’s life is linked at every stage with the concurrent developments in Indian (and Pakistani) history, and because of this, he is doomed to mirror all the political fissures in his personal story.Though his story is intertwined with that of India, Saleem manages to forge his own version of history; at multiple points, he makes factual errors, such as misstating the date of Gandhi’s death. For Saleem, however, his account is no less true for these inaccuracies, and indeed Saleem believes that they consecrate his alternate account of events. This idea of a subjective narrative is so important in both magical realism and post-colonialism, and yet to me, Saleem’s subjectivity is most important for the manner in which is aids in the creation of an enchanted world separate from our own.This, in the end, is Rushdie’s greatest accomplishment: Midnight’s Children is an exquisite piece of storytelling above all else. The reader is made a participant, intertwined in Saleem’s journey, as the listener to a tale of folklore is. It is for this reason that Midnight’s Children is the finest novel I’ve read recently, and I’m certain it will become one of my favorite books.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>The tale of Saleem Sinai who is born at midnight on August 15th, 1947 at the precise moment of India"s Independence linking his fate forever with his country"s. The story begins with Saleem"s grandfather and how he met his grandmother and continues until the beginnings of the generation after Saleem. As Saleem was born at midnight, he has been given special powers which he shares with his nemesis born at the same time in the same hospital. The other children born throughout India born in the midnight hour also have powers and they come together to form the Midnight Children"s Conference which Saleem hopes will better the world.The story is epic covering so much history and it becomes even more soas events unfold and small incidences come back to haunt Saleem and lead to much bigger events. It is very hard to review this book without giving much of the plot away so I appologise that this is a little vague. It did take me a little while to get into Rushdie"s writing style as it is very disjointed with the narrator (Saleem) skipping forwards and backwards in time often within the same sentence. Once I got into it, I really enjoyed it and loved the language and style. I warmed to many of the characters despite their many flaws which are discussed at length in the story.Just to give you a little taste of his writing style here are a couple of extracts:"I was born in the sity of Bombay... once upon a time. No, that won"t do, there"s no getting away from the date: I was born in Doctor Narlikar"s Nursing Home on August 15th, 1947. And the time? The time matters, too. Well then: it was at night. No, it"s important to be more... On the stroke of midnight, as a matter of fact. Clock-hands joined palms in respectful greeting as I came. Oh, spell it out, spell it out; at the precise moment of India"s arrival at Independence, I tumbled forth into the world.""No colours except green and black the walls are green the sky is black (there is no roof) the stars are green the Widow is green but her hair is black as black. The Widow sits on a high high chair the chair is green the seat is black the Widow"s hair has a centre-parting it is green on the left and on the right black. High as the sky the chair is green the seat is black the Widow"s arm is long as death its skin is green the fingernails are long and sharp and black."I do recommend it if you can get past the first 50-100 pages and I will definitely be reading more by Rushdie in the future. I can see where Zadie Smith gets some of her inspiration after reading this novel.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>Midnight"s Children by Salman Rushdie is a sweeping description of how Saleem Sinai has happened to become one of Midnight"s Children, born at the precise moment India became a nation. It has been a while since reading any Rushdie (having only read Satanic Verses in the past), but it is typical of his grand style, filled with memories and myth. An excellent book.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>I was stuck in this long and dense book for many weeks.  It was impossible to speed up the reading, the language was to baroque, the descriptions fantastic, and the culture strange.  It is a very comic book in most ways, never quite serious although describing many failed or sad lives.  The narrator, Saleem Sinai, or “snotnose” as he calls himself, has a gift of telepathy, that he uses to organize other children borne at midnight on the day of India’s independence.  He loosely describes the fortunes of his Muslim family in Bombay and Pakistan in the years from 1948 through 1971.  It is a fantasy, with miraculous events, outrageous characters, and unusual occurences.  The mighty knees of Shiva; the Brass Monkey who becomes the Jamina Singer, his grandfather, uncles, cousins and friends.  Enjoyable but a bit tedious, sometimes very little progress while descriptions multiply</rev:text>

   <rev:text>3674.  Midnight"s Children, by Salman Rushdie  (read 5 Jan 2003) This is no. 90 on the list of 100 greatest books in English published in the 20th century as selected by a Modern Library panel, and I admit I read it because it reduced to two on that 100 best list unread by me.  Not too enjoyable though one became used to it.  It is an "epic" and deals with a Hindu born at midnight on Aug. 15, 1947--the moment of India"s independence.  But the account starts with said child"s father, born in 1915.  Full of fantasy, something hard for me to enjoy, it tells of all kinds of weird happenings and not in spare and appealing language of Naipaul.  I am glad I have read it, but it was not easy to appreciate while I was reading.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>Magical realism. A strange and ironically funny book. The main character was born on the stroke of midnight on the day that India declared its independence. He lives a bizarre life with uncanny paralells to the history of his country.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>This is the second Rushdie I took to reading, after Haroun and the Sea of Stories. I must say that with Midnight"s Children I suddenly realized why he is considered a great writer. It is truly an epic book, and I only wish that I knew more about the history of India before I began. The only analogy I can make is that of watching Forrest Gump with no knowledge of American history. Saleem Sinai, our anti-hero, is at the heart of every major event in the first thirty years of India"s history as an independent nation. The style is one which I have never encountered before. It is at times incredibly rushed. Our narrator has just days to live (by his account) and in order to encapsulate everything, he states upfront the outlines, the catchphrases of his life. There are premonitions, fortunes, strange feverish dreams that only get explained later. And after the important events, there are endless repercussions, connections to previous and future events. It"s like he gives you the web of connections first and only later tells what actually occurred. Even in the sentence structure itself it is Germanic in its haste, creating words if necessary to encompass the right idea. He is "beholden to what"s-next-ism" when he returns to the plot after a particularly long tangent. And there are moments of incredibly powerful imagery. When he walks through a field of dead soldiers, I had to stop reading, gape in awe and reread that passage. That is what good writing is: something that hits you so hard you have to stop and catch your breath.I"ll take a cue from the introduction and mention his similarities to authors of his generation such as Garcia Marquez and Gunther Grass. As soon as that was mentioned I could see it myself. He has the same long arc, the same attention to every detail of life, and he does not shy away from the grotesque or impossible. I might have shied away from quite so much wallowing, but I can see what Rushdie was trying to achieve. Here he has a narrator who by self-description has messianic visions of his role in Indian history, and you realize by the end that he is no more than an everyman, delusional, inspired perhaps, but nothing more.Not every page was easy to get through, but the writing was addictive, the imagery intense. I think I have enough of a sense of Rushdie that I don"t need to read more, but I"m certainly glad I spent a week or two on this fine book.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>I started out thinking that this book would be intimidating, but it"s certainly not. Rushdie"s prose is engaging and readable, even when he does quirky things, like eliminate the serial comma. The result is a multilayered novel that you can read as deeply or as lightly as you choose. Excellent.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>It took me well over a month to read this book. Partly because I"ve been extremely busy with my thesis. Partly because it was hard to get into. The first two fifths or so are not that captivating.  Once I got to a certain point, a bit before the halfway mark, however, it turned into a completely different kind of story than I was expecting. Magical realism! In India! Once that fact was established, it was a quick read. I really should"ve known, though. It is, after all, Salman Rushdie. Magical realism is his genre.There is an incredibly rich, detailed, complicated story at work here. Tons of interesting characters (just try and keep track of them!) and none of them seem transparent or under-developed.Midnight"s Children was well worth the initial time-investment. I highly recommend it. A side-benefit was that my nascent fascination-obsession with India grew by leaps and bounds!</rev:text>

   <rev:text>Midnight’s Children is the pseudo-autobiography of Saleem Sinai, the first baby born in independent India. Saleem tells the story of his life, as enmeshed in the history of the first 31 years of post-colonial India and entwined in the lives of the other 1,000 children born between midnight and 1:00 a.m. on the first day of the new country. Saleem describes this complicated, vivid, magical, funny, and disturbing mix as the "chutnification of history."    This was the first novel Salman Rushdie wrote and the first of his that I have read. I could kick myself for waiting so long. This book is a delight.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>Another epic novel that is both stimulating, captivating, poignant and well-written. Rushdie delivers an engrossing tale of a turbulent, political India as experienced and narrated by the principle character, Saleem Sinai, who was born on the eve of India"s Independence. By turns fantastical and abrupt, one plunges into Saleem"s world as it is intertwined with the events of this era, with ease and joy.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>The author of The Satanic Verses creates a fascinating family saga about the birth and maturity of a land and its people - a brilliant incarnation of the human comedy. It’s a fascinating family saga set against the colourful background of the India of the 20th century. Saleem Sinai was born at midnight, the midnight of India"s independence, and is mysteriously "handcuffed to history" by the coincidence. He is one of 1,001 children born at the midnight hour, each of them endowed with an extraordinary talent - and whose privilege and curse it is to be both master and victims of their times.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>i had a harder time getting into this book than satanic verses, probably because i came into it with doubts about the rather fantastical premise the story is founded on.  imagine my surprise when, once i got into it, i found it to be an even greater masterpiece than the verses.  rushdie"s unique style and sardonic humor are always great fun, and what this story comes down to is an entertaining commentary on an important part of international history.  easily one of my all-time faves and highly recommended.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>the mother of all novels about India’s birth pangs and growing pains? this book is an explosion of wondrous sights and pungent smells, tapping into and deconstructing the myths and history of the country.yet for all its breadth, it also feels like an intimate portrayal because of the device rushdie has concocted – a group of magical midnight’s children, born in the hour of india’s independence, to mirror the nation’s development. the focus of the sprawling story is further sharpened by another device – the re-telling of history by one saleem sinai, born on the stroke of midnight itself, to his devoted audience of one (and the reader.) with the benefit of hindsight,the smallest event has the portentousness of history and the heavy shadow of fate lurks everywhere. this is simultaneously undercut by the triviality of these happenings.there is much to savour in the playfulness and inventiveness of his writing and the dazzling array of fascinating characters and plot developments. despite the sheer number of elements, rushdie does a dextrous job of juggling them with a fluidity that belies the complexity of the task.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>I really enjoyed his magical writing style and learned alot about India, Pakistan, Bangladesh (some of which I had to look up to understand the book) The imagery and originality were fabulous -- like an Indian version of One Hundred years of Solitude. I will say that at times I was bamboozled by just exactly what was going on -- I get that it was allegorical, but I am afraid that I lack the cultural and historical knowledge to put it all together.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>It is a challenging read and it helps to know a bit of history of the modern India.  I find it very difficultin the beginning but after persisting, it becomes very rewarding.  The story narrates the magical life of the main character and runs parallel with every major events in India"s early history.  The superstitous side of India hits a brick wall that is called modernity and the magical tradition wavered away in a very tragic way.  It is a power story that left me very stun.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>A fascinating and (dare I say) postmodernist saga of Saleem Sanai and his "magical" birth at the very moment of India"s independence from Britain. Packed with beautiful descriptions, entertaining flights of fancy a la magical realism, and even some historical fact, Midnight"s Children requires some devotion to finish, but it is worth it.However, I must say that I have liked other of Rushdie"s books better, though "Midnight"s Children" is the famous Booker Prize winner. Read "The Ground Beneath Her Feet" and "The Satanic Verses" for characters that truly stay with you for months afterward!</rev:text>
