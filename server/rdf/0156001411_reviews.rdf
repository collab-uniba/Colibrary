   <rev:text>The Gospel According to Jesus ChristLet"s get this warning written upfront first...if you are a born again Christian or in any other way easily offended by an unorthodox and even blasphemous portrait of one of the most revered and worshiped figures in human history, skip this book entirely. Saramago is not exactly an atheist, but he is a skeptic, and this is a skeptic"s look at the Gospels. Saramago plays fast and loose with the canonical Gospel accounts of the life of Christ to create something very different than the comfortable picture of Christ most of us have grown up with. And to my mind, the questions that Saramago raises in his book are good ones, ones that every sincere person of faith should ask. They are not questions that can break a strong faith, but they are ones that hone it and refine it. From the first glowing chapter of this book, I was hooked. Saramago begins the work with a poetic description of the traditional icon of Christ"s crucifixion. But from that moment, he wanders far from the Gospel accounts. The first half of the book concerns the events of Christ"s birth and boyhood. Joseph, by not warning the citizens of Bethlehem of the murder of the innocents, incurs a bloodguilt that he cannot absolve except by his own mistaken death on the cross years later. This death of his earthly father along with the accompanying sense of bloodguilt haunts the young Jesus and sends him off on a journey to find his own true purpose in life. He spends years as a shepherd apprentice with a man named Pastor who ultimately is the Devil. He meets and falls in love with Mary Magdelene, with whom he lives without the benefit of marriage. He discovers his amazing powers healing and miracle working long before he has any idea of how he is to use them. All through this section, familiar passages from the Gospels such as the calling of the disciples, the walking on the water, and the feeding of the five thousand are presented in unfamiliar guises. Finally, in the last chapter, all of the events of the canonical gospels are condensed into a searing climax. Saramago has a talent for grasping the logical contradictions in Christian faith, though he seems blind to the spiritual depth that lies behind these contradictions. Saramago senses the great paradox between the "all good" God and the need for the atonement of His Son. Saramago"s portrait of God is almost a caricature. God is bombastic, greedy for worship and power, and ultimately vain. In many ways, Saramago"s version of God resembles the Demiurge of the Gnostics or the Urizen of William Blake....a petty creator god who wants the whole deal for himself. And in Pastor, Saramago creates a devil who"s biggest motivator is compassion for the plight of humanity. At times, these characters approach broad comedy. And yet, Saramago is skillful in his handling of language, so that even the most satirical moments have a bittersweet undertone. Throughout the novel, Saramago"s prose is brilliant, approaching poetry. Yet it is simple and once you get past the idiosyncratic punctuation, the lines flow beautifully. For language alone, this novel is a wonderful read. Add to that the wealth of historical detail, vivid characterizations and searching questions and this is a novel that challenges the reader to think hard and respond deeply. Saramago"s questions challenge Christians, but to my mind they don"t break the faith. In fact, a faith that can"t stand up to a little blasphemy is not much of a faith at all.</rev:text>

   <rev:text><![CDATA["The Gospel According to Jesus Christ" is going to offend a lot of people and one can understand on reading it why it sent the Vatican into a terminal fit.  Taken on its merits, it"s an awesome work of scholarship by a writer with a deep knowledge of the life of Christ, Christian and Jewish theology and biblical literature. Saramago gives us a Christ that is all too fallible; he"s human, after all, as well as divine; a Joseph whose sin of omission in saving his own child from Herod"s assassins while failing to warn other parents of the imminent slaughter of the innocents was expiated by his own death on a cross that foreshadowed the death of his son; a Mary who doubted her son"s divinity, and a Mary Magdalene who relieved Jesus of his virginity and remained totally faithful to him afterwards, bodily and spiritually, up to the end.  Even more disturbing for some readers will be Saramago"s depiction of God as a master manipulator, pulling the strings behind the scenes, needing the devil as a foil for his own glory because he knows that without the devil, his glory is diminished.  What kind of God is this? 

One can"t help but wonder, while reading this book, what was Saramago trying to say to us?  Is the book a testimony to his own cynicism and atheism, or does Saramago believe in God and Jesus Christ in spite of himself?  Because his subject, Jesus as Man/God, comes out as eminently sympathetic, likeable, sometimes irritating, always fascinating; unlike the remote, other-worldly Jesus of Sunday school, Saramago"s Jesus is someone we can relate to.  And Saramago"s God echoes the question all of us have asked from time to time -- how can a benevolent God create a world in which the innocent are allowed to suffer?  It"s Saramago"s suggestion that perhaps God himself can"t answer that one, that may disturb so many readers of this book.

Saramago"s writing style has been called convoluted, but it wasn"t difficult at all for this reader; his paragraphs may go on for pages, but he writes with a sweep and flow that wraps the reader up and carries him or her right along with the narrative.  "The Gospel According to Jesus Christ" is totally enveloping; one turns the final page and emerges slightly dazed at having been through a reading experience that blows both the mind and the senses.]]></rev:text>

   <rev:text>I read Saramago"s "Gospel" more than a month ago, and it continues to haunt my imagination. Pick it up. Scan the pages. You"ll probably think this is a forbidding work, written in dense, often pages-long, paragraphs, with lengthy stretches of run-together dialogue uninterrupted by paragraph indentations or white space. But begin reading, and all hesitation melts away. The writing is stately, scriptural in diction, careful of every nuance. Saramago"s original Portuguese, movingly translated into English by Giovanni Pontiero, creates a convincing "gospel voice"--rendered from an ambiguous, perhaps "omniscient," perspective-to portray Jesus of Nazareth in a startlingly new, and believable, way. And into this narrative Saramago adds credible, plausibly motivated, portraits of Joseph, Mary, James "the Brother of Jesus," as well as of both the Deity and the Demon. And, of course, Mary of Magdala.What could a Portuguese atheist (and, perhaps less relevantly, Communist) have to say about the life of Jesus? Don"t presume a thing. Simply read, slowly. What will first be apparent is that Saramago respects your intelligence and the sources, and he has done his homework in speculating on how the historical gaps might be filled in: he knows the New Testament, has studied the "Gnostic Gospels" of NT apocrypha, has read his Josephus and other near-contemporary accounts of the "Jewish Wars" and first-century Palestine, and seems familiar with the scholarly Jesus Seminar findings. You will then note the expected traces of irony--sometimes fired from unexpected directions--but here deployed surprisingly to draw out the humanity of Jesus"s nature and, in my view, to lure the reader into an early misreading of the author"s intent. Indeed, the spell Saramago creates throughout the novel"s first half issues from what seems a predictably humanistic, psychological point of view. That changes. But I don"t feel I can say any more about the direction Saramago takes his story without spoiling for others what was for me a surprising and thrilling narrative transformation, with a string of unexpected, powerful payoffs. Nor can I pretend to say with any confidence that I know which readers Saramago"s novel will appeal to most. Each will find Saramago"s telling of the Jesus story challenging in his or her own way. What I can do, though, is encourage you-if Saramago"s stature as a Nobel laureate is insufficiently encouraging-to keep an open mind, read the book, and ponder the philosophical and theological questions raised in an unforgettable work of literary art.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>A great book, both for open minded believers and non-believers. It tells the story of Jesus life in a prosaic way. It is a story about life, death and fate. According to the author Jesus is more a man then a God and, like  any other man, many times doesn"t understand God"s reasons but, although he  tries, he can"t oppose to God"s will. There is a long dialog among Jesus,  God and the Devil, the three of them on a boat surrounded by mist, which is  very intense. In many parts it is strongly ironical and very witty.  Some  description are really accurate and full of details. It is a book that,  after being read, leaves the reader with something to think about.</rev:text>

   <rev:text><![CDATA[I arrived at his 377-page fictional life of Jesus after first reading Jose Saramago"s more recent novel, BLINDNESS, which was published in 1998, the same year the Portugese writer won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Both novels reveal a gifted writer at the heights of his talent. Saramago"s life of Jesus covers familiar Biblical territory, including the mysterious Annunciation, his birth in a cave followed by the Slaughter of the Innocents, his flight from home and his retreat into the desert, his miracles, and his Crucifixion. It also strays bravely from the Gospels into areas such as Joseph"s crucifixion and Jesus"s loss of virginity to Mary Magdalene, areas that will undoubtedly leave many readers feeling uncomfortable. For believers and unbelievers, Saramago"s novel should be travelled with an open mind.

Saramago"s story of Jesus operates on a realistic level. Angels appear as beggars, God appears as a cloud of dust, and the Devil appears as a shepherd named "Pastor." One notable exception, however, occurs at pages 305 to 362, where Jesus, God, and the Devil share a boat on a lake for a profound dialogue. Saramago creates a protagonist in Jesus who not only appreciates the joys of what it means to be human--family, nature, and eros, but who also demonstrates unwavering loyalty to God. Throughout his life, he is haunted by nightmares of a father who wants to kill him.

Saramago"s fictional account of the life of Jesus is nothing less than brilliant.  Those readers interested in such fiction should also read QUARANTINE, Jim Crace"s fascinating account of Jesus"s forty days in the wilderness.

   <rev:text>2,000 years in, and a vast portion of our world"s population is still enchanted by the idea that a storybook prince is the one and only conduit to God and that anyone outside of that system can go to hell. Saramago, Portugal"s premier cynic and atheist, leaves his cynicism and atheism slightly beneath the surface, but only slightly. Jesus is a wonderful and extremely engaging figure in this charming, though slightly belated retelling. It is the figure of God himself who is the dubious party, calling into existence this mad sequence of events, knowing full well the repercussions over the next few thousand years. Saramago transfers the somewhat impish Yahweh of the Original Testament into the Gospels, and everything seems fairly Last Temptation-ish until the last 50 or so pages, when Saramago"s acid begins to bleed through. His archaic language seems just right for the time and place, and his highly idiosyncratic use of paragraph and punctuation is peculiar at first but quite easy to get used to. The extended 3-way conversation between Christ, God, and the Devil is an astonishing writerly feat--at once humorous and heartbreaking, and perfectly sets up Saramago"s unexpected finale. If you are not one who worships the Gospels as divine scripture, and wouldn"t be offended by a freer, more psychological portrait of Christ, then this is a fine read.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>I was raised amid a curious religious whiplash due to experiencing both Catholicism and Protestantism because of my parents" divorces and remarriages, so I came to this book with a little bit of cynicism and a lot  of hope.  I wanted desparately to see Jesus Christ in a clear and loving  light, not the common, goofy glow often cast by the silly modern American  preachers to whom I"d been forced to listen for so many years.  Saramago"s  novel begins with a poetic word portrait of a painting of the famous  crucifixion and ends it (we all know how it ends!) with the same event  retold in his own brilliant and powerful fashion. This book is the first of  Saramago"s I have read, and having experienced it, I will go on to read all  of his novels. The Jesus we meet in this novel is real, and it doesn"t  matter what one"s religious background or belief, this telling is  believeable and inspiring.  The third person narrator, We, provides the  story behind the story abridged by modern religion while renewing and  creating metaphors that tell this beautiful tale with passion, humorous  asides, entertaining irony and compassion. Saramago"s Christ is a real  person with depth and personality and heart.  He is a Christ we can see as  a man and a son of God--one we can imagine actually living and experiencing  the horrific events we have learned about through organized religion.  The  difference is this:  Saramago is a brilliant writer with both vision and  education.  His passion is his own miracle in retelling Christ"s life, and  he fills it with magic and thoroughly philosophical and extraordinary  considerations. Jesus Christ"s conversations with all of the historical  characters in this book are mesmerizing.Reading this book, I was deeply  awed by this writer"s talent.  It is one of the finest novels I have ever  read and contains passages that absolutely stunned me and which I read and  reread and will reread for years to come.  If you are searching for a novel  that will truly blow your mind, look no further.  Saramago is a genius.</rev:text>

   <rev:text>One of my favorite novels of all time. Even in translation, Saramago"s book manages to be powerful, instructive, humorous, and inspiring - and in some ways more beautiful and tragic than the original telling in the Good Book itself. TGATJC is written as a more literal and objective version of the New Testament, where the characters" thoughts and motives are the core focus of the story. Jesus is for the most part an unwilling participant in God"s greater plans to "advertise" himself, and stuggles with the revelation that he is indeed the "lamb of God." Throughout the book, Jesus explores his humanity through making friendships, finding love, and conversing with the devil. The true beauty of the work is Saramago"s ability to heighten your sympathy and compassion for Christ by presenting him as a far less "perfect" being, one who is much easier to identify with. The conversation between Christ, God and the Devil is definitely a highlight of the story, and many of the ideas discussed were both eye opening and rather frightening. Saramago provides some very interesting thoughts on the purpose of religion, the morality of Satan and the personal motives of God himself. This book is written in the same vein as Satanic Verses, so beware if you"re easily offended by alternative presentations of religious ideology.</rev:text>

   <rev:text><![CDATA[José Saramago is one of the all-time greatest writers of portuguese language, along with Machado de Assis and Guimarães Rosa. He deservedly won the Nobel Prize a few years ago, the first portuguese-language writer to achieve such honor. Saramago has a unique style of writing, with very long sentences, fast dialogues inserted in the middle of the phrases, little punctuation and a fluid narrative. And yet, it"s not difficult to read Saramago, at least not in his original language. 

After reading "Baltazar and Blimunda" ("O memorial do convento", original title), I went after everything fictional Saramago has written. In my opinion, his imagination, his talent to write prose and his skills at telling a story leave the reader no option but to be completely absorbed by the letters, the words, the paragraphs and the pages. "The gospel according to Jesus Christ" ("O evengelho segundo Jesus Cristo", original title) is another example of how good and original Saramago can be. 

Saramago, a declared atheist, provides us, mere mortals, with a different view of Jesus" life. For example, Mel Gibson"s movie "The passion of the Christ", chose to portrait Jesus" death, with graphic violence, torturing scenes, and many tears - and that"s the usual nowadays association; people relate to violence, to dualism and manicheism. "The gospel according to Jesus Christ", instead, is Saramago"s story of what Jesus" life could have been. The book portraits Jesus as a very common human being, literally burdened by a covenant with God. Philosophical and theological discussions are present in every page, not in a mechanical, boring way, but always with witty, inteligent remarks by the author. The dualism is still present, but it leaves room to discussion. 

"The gospel according to Jesus Christ" is a polemic, different work, but a mandatory reading nonetheless.

   <rev:text>This book is probably not for the intensely religious, true believer type, for it paints a very radical view of the life of Christ. From negating the Virgin birth to the real reason for the crucifixion, this book tells us the tale of a very confused individual pushed and pulled by a God with His own selfish agenda for the future. It shows a conflicted man whose entire life is an enigma leading to an ending preordained by a higher power. That being said, it is tremendously well written, with moments of high drama and low comedy. The characters are exceedingly well drawn and the story moves along very well to its tragic conclusion. It turns much of the New Testament on its ear, but does show the power and the future glory of Jesus. There may be a sceptic behind the writing, but there is religion also, and a belief in the ineffable power of God. I"m sure the author may disagree quite violently with me, but he has more faith than he is willing to admit. This book did not shake my own faith or belief, for I recognize that it is fiction, and the author"s idea of what happened all that long ago in Israel. He is entitled to his opinion, and I to mine, and that"s how intellectual debate lives on.</rev:text>

   <rev:text><![CDATA[The Gospel According to Jesus Christ is a distinctly non-traditional novel
in both style and substance.  

I am intrigued by religious books by non-religious people.  (Well, non-traditionally
religious, and non-fundamentalist, certainly).  It’s a human attempt by a thoughtful and creative soul
to cut through the centuries of accumulated baggage and try to drag some relevant human truth
out of the biblical stories.  I was intrigued by his treatment of Joseph, and a
mirror image of atonement that Jesus presents for his earthly father’s sins, I
was mesmerized by a misty encounter on a boat between Jesus, God, and the
Devil, and I was stunned by the last sentence of the book.  I really enjoyed the
realistic portrayal of these well-known characters, especially the “Marys”, who came
off as real women and not as story props.  Well done.

I would be careful about who to recommend the book to, though.  Religious folk
will be put off, I’m sure and there are certainly doctrinal problems here, not the least
of which is an abortive reimagining of Jesus’ raising of Lazarus--a wonderfully
mordant existentialist take on that whole affair.

Non-religious folk will have to have the determination to sit through “that old story
again”.    Of course, I found the novel to be most compelling in the areas between
the familiar story, where Saramago has the broader canvas upon which to paint.  Some
parts felt like just going down the laundry list of events and miracles, but I suppose they
needed to be there.

 I really enjoyed the writing style, I have read that it is a barrier to some readers of 
Saramago, but I was swept away by it.    He tends towards run on sentences, and
missing punctuation, to poetic effect.

Give this one a try if you"re poetically inclined and philosophically curious about
the Christian tradition.]]></rev:text>

   <rev:text>Je treba vedeti, da je Jose Saramago, portugalski nobelovec, komunist. In nič kaj naklonjen našemu Gospodu Jezusu Kristusu in njegovi Cerkvi. Je pa pravi pisatelj (njegov Esej o slepoti je treba brati) in če se tak loti tako pomembne teme, kot je literarna interpretacija evangelija, lahko pričakujemo zanimive uvide. Knjiga se bere, vendar sem bil nemalo razočaran. Ne zato, ker si Saramago, po mojem precej po nepotrebnem in samo zato, da bi socialistično doktrinarsko povečal težo Jožefa, delavca, izmisli celoten Jožefov življenjepis z njegovim grehom, ki je v tem, da ni preprečil pokola betlehemskih otročičev, vred. Ne zato, ker združi Jezusa in Magdaleno v pravi meseni boemski ljubezni – nad tem naj se zgražajo cerkvenjaki, meni so se zdeli opisi te ljubezni lepi in prepričljivi. Na določenem mestu se Saramagova intuicija približa tistemu, kar se tudi meni zdi bistveno, namreč zapovedi, naj se človeka ne žrtvuje višjim ciljem, pa vse skupaj zvodeni v povsem neumestni alegoriji meglenih pogajanj med Bogom in Satanom. V zajetnem »romanu« je preveč površnega posmeha in premalo resnega poskusa razumeti Jezusovo pot in sporočilo.</rev:text>

   <rev:text><![CDATA[Saramago deftly embraces historical facts, myth and reality and juggles them in this extraordinarily fictitious account of Jesus Christ. The novel is an in-depth psychological portrait of a savior who possesses a touch of humanity so much more substantial than the Bible claims. Jesus who is at once the Son of God, the beginning and the end, men"s destiny, and a young man of the earth is an interweaving of letters, irony, spirituality, irreverence, humanity, and foible.
The novel hinges on the fact that Jesus" father, Joseph of Nazareth, out of cowardice and selfishness of the heart, failed to alert the parents that King Herod had issued a decree to kill boys under the age of 3. He could have spared the lives of 27 children had he spoken up. Joseph felt the scruple of running off to save his own son but had forfeited the lives of others. The guilt he felt was exactly guilt a man may feel without having sinned or committed the actual crime himself. It was the sin of omission.

To assuage his remorse that incessantly plagued him, Joseph, as he truly believed he was acting out of his own accord and obeying God"s will, made strenuous effort to beget more and more children to compensate for the 27 lives. When Jesus learned about Joseph"s crime, Jesus felt poignant for his father but asserted that his father was to blame for the deaths of innocent children. Joseph"s sin was illustrated to full actuality as Jesus envisaged infants dying in perfect innocence and parents who had done nothing wrong. Jesus was embittered and broken at the fact that never was a man more guilty than his own father, who had sinned to save his life.

Joseph"s death, which was rather dramatic and undeserving, bore the scruple of his own conscience and arose the question of what awaited him after death. Would it be possible than everything ended with death? What would happen to the life"s sorrow and sufferings, especially the sufferings right before the last breath? What about the memory if time is such an undulating surface than can only be accessed by memory, would memory of such suffering linger at least for a short period of time? Saramago has repeatedly made claims to explore the notion of after-death and its correlation to human existence throughout the novel.

Jesus under Saramago"s pen is not as perfect, impure, and righteous as the Bible portraits him to be. One sees that the savior succumbs to temptation, to not receiving the cup of death, to choose to remain on earth and not to be crowned with glory. The most provocative and controversial aspect of the book is when Jesus intervened the stoning of an adulteress, which brought him to awareness that he was living in sin with Mary Magdalene, and thus living in defiance to God"s will. The sin of adultery (sexual immorality as the Bible claims) brought Jesus into open conflict with the observed law. 

The book is not deprived of interesting dialogues in spite of the serious overtones of theology. My favorite is the conversation in which the Devil pleaded with God to admit him into the kingdom. God curtly denied the request asserting than the good God represented would cease to exist without the evil Devil represented. In regard to the meaning of human existence and the pursuit of holiness, Saramago does leave us with an enlightening thought (with such sober dignity) that the soul, in order to be able to boast of a clean and blameless body, has burdened itself with sadness, envy and impurity.]]></rev:text>

   <rev:text><![CDATA[Blurp: Het evangelie volgens Jezus Christus veroorzaakte bij verschijning in Portugal veel opschudding. Toen het boek door ministerieel ingrijpen werd geschrapt van de kandidatenlijst voor de Europese Literatuurprijs, kwam het tot een forse politieke rel. "Het bevat scènes, beweringen, uitroepen, gedachten, die een schrijver enkele eeuwen geleden op de brandstapel hadden gebracht, zonder recht op een begrafenis," aldus een Portugese krant. José Saramago, winnaar van de Nobelprijs voor de Literatuur 1998, geeft in deze roman zijn eigen versie van het Nieuwe Testament. Voor hem is Jezus Christus een volledig menselijk wezen, derhalve ook begiftigd met seksualiteit. Zijn partner is Maria Magdalena, die in het boek uitgroeit tot een uiterst vitale vrouw, vol kracht en wijsheid. Ook de verhouding tussen God en Duivel komt bij Saramago op verrassende wijze in een nieuw licht te staan. Zijn evangelie, het evangelie van een atheïst, geeft een zeer persoonlijke en tegendraadse interpretatie van de aloude tradities. - Heel in de verte is de lach van God te horen, om ons eraan te herinneren dat de waarheid niet eenduidig is en de mens altijd ontgaat. - Publico. - Het evangelie volgens Jezus Christus zal de immpact krijgen van een torpedo en ontploffen in het hart van de katholieke dogma"s. - O Ribatejo. - De schurk van dit evangelie is God zelf. - O Ribatejo. - Over De stad der blinden: - Lees deze roman en huiver. - PZC. - De tijdloze meerwaarde van De stad der blinden bevestigt de oprechte keuze van Saramago als winnaar van de prestigieuze Nobelprijs voor Literatuur. - Trouw.
Samenv.: Levensbeschrĳving van Christus vanuit niet-gelovige visie.
Samenv.: De R.K.-kerk heeft geen Inquisitie meer anders was het slecht afgelopen met Saramago, de Portugese schrijver van dit eigentijdse anti-evangelie. Hij verslaat het leven van Jezus Christus als dat van een zoon die rebelleert tegen een verwaten en willekeurige God de Vader. Maar al is Saramago niet in de positie van een Rushdie, Portugal stond niettemin op z"n kop toen dit boek uitkwam. Schokkend is behalve de persoonlijke, niet door geloof gestuurde, sarcastische interpretatie van het Nieuwe Testament vooral de vermenselijking van hoofdpersonen als genoemde Jezus, zijn vriendin Maria Magdalena, Jozef, Maria, met hun eigenaardigheden en behoeften die besmuikt maken omdat wij hen altijd in een sfeer van heiligheid hebben gewaand. Aardig is dat door de schrijver bij sommige delen uit het Testament verrassend kort, bij andere - de kindermoord - juist lang wordt stilgestaan. Zijn realisme is doorspekt met veel wondermooie zinsneden die hun kracht ook ontlenen aan de verrassende positie van de romanstof ten opzichte van voor iedereen overbekend, gewijd cultuurgoed. Het nederlands van de vertaling is zeer overtuigend en bruist.]]></rev:text>
